Providing legal identity to all involves the collection and processing of large quantities of personal data. As privacy continues to be recognised as a crucial human right around the world, the collection and processing of such data must adhere to globally established standards of data protection. With the increase in digitisation of social and economic infrastructure, governments have expanded the use of new digital technologies in identity management schemes, to potentially enhance the delivery of public and welfare services. This shift, although with the potential to be beneficial, raises certain unique challenges from the perspective of protecting the privacy rights of individuals. Consequently, it behoves UN Member States to establish robust data protection laws and institutional frameworks when designing modern-day legal identity systems. Additionally, increased internet penetration has meant an increase in the cross-border flow of personal data for the provision of services, making data protection frameworks essential to ensure robust standards of privacy around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred UN Member States to increase their reliance on technology as they seek to manage its effects on their populations. While technological solutions have played a significant role in the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic, they have also highlighted the prospective privacy risks that accompany digitisation, and have made the formulation of robust data protection laws and institutional frameworks more urgent. In this context, this report aims to provide UN Member States with suggested guidance on developing domestic data protection legislation, and creating a robust privacy- protecting regulatory framework.",

The development of international and regional data protection frameworks dates back to the 1970s and 1980s. Early examples of frameworks include the OECD Guidelines governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (1980) and the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (1981). Since then, several regional frameworks have emerged, and demonstrate the growing consensus on core data protection principles while also reflecting diversity in regional approaches.

However, emerging scholarship also recognises that placing the onus of privacy entirely on individuals through notice and consent policies may result in compromised protection due to factors, such as \u2018consent fatigue\u2019 and power asymmetries between data subjects and data controllers. Purpose limitation: Collected data must only be used for the purposes that it was collected for, or those legitimately connected to this original purpose. This principle guards against collected data being misused later in its lifecycle for unforeseen purposes, especially in a manner that may impact individual privacy. Data minimisation: Data minimisation is one of the core data protection principles, and it calls for limiting data collection to only what is required to fulfil a specific and legitimate purpose. By mandating the collection of as little data as possible, this principle protects against excessive data aggregation and the privacy harms associated with this practice. Integrity, confidentiality, and availability: These principles impose obligations on data controllers and processors to treat individuals\u2019 personal data with a minimum standard of care to foster information security and data protection. Adopting reasonable security safeguards mitigate against risks such as unauthorised access or use and the destruction or loss of data, among others.

If a controller or processor has incorrect information, data subjects may be excluded from public welfare and financial services if they are not able to correct errors. The rights to rectification and the right against automated decision-making also guard against unfair or incorrect outcomes based on an individual\u2019s data. Establishing comprehensive data standards therefore ensures equal and fair treatment and safeguards human rights. The right to be forgotten: The right to be forgotten is a contemporary data protection right that enables data subjects to request that their data is erased in certain circumstances. In the digital context, this right is usually exercised to require search engines and websites to remove information from search results and webpages. The operationalisation of this right can have significant implications for access to information and the freedom of expression, and it must be carefully balanced against these factors. Comprehensive data protection: Rights, such as the right to object to or restrict processing, data portability and allowing third parties to exercise rights on behalf of data subjects support the exercise of other data protection rights and objectives, as well as provide comprehensive protection to data subjects.",

    "text": "This report recognises that governments are likely to be among the largest public collectors and processors of data, and proceeds to identify the first principles applicable to government access of personal data in the context of a data protection law. Data protection frameworks provide exemptions to the state from data protection obligations for certain legitimate purposes, such as national security, maintaining public order, and undertaking criminal investigations. Chapter 7 explores the requirements that such exemptions are typically required to conform to. Applicable safeguards: Typically, under international human rights law, restrictions on core fundamental rights such as the right to privacy require the restrictions to: (i) be provided by law; (ii) not be arbitrary; (iii) pursue a legitimate aim; and (iv) be necessary and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. These factors aim to narrowly tailor restrictions on rights and seek to balance legitimate governmental objectives with the rights of data subjects. Narrow, targeted exemptions: It is essential for data protection principles and obligations in regulatory frameworks to apply to both the government and the private sector, especially given that the right to privacy is an internationally recognised human right. In order to have an effective data protection framework that safeguards the right to privacy, any exemptions for governments to obligations under data protection regulatory frameworks must be narrowly tailored, specific, proportional to the aims sought to be achieved, and contain robust safeguards to ensure accountability.",

However, legal identity programmes raise a corollary concern for the right to privacy of the individuals whose data is being collected and processed in the operationalisation of these programmes. The adoption of the Identified Regional Frameworks demonstrates a widespread recognition of the need and desire to protect the privacy of individuals as legal identity programmes are implemented across the world. Data protection has emerged as a key tool to guarantee the right to privacy, autonomy, and dignity of the individual without stymieing legal identity programmes or technological innovation. The remaining chapters of this report discuss the various elements of data protection legislation based on a study of the Identified Regional Frameworks.",

For instance, the GDPR offers a broad definition of the term personal data and focuses on whether the available data can identify a natural person based on \u201can analysis of all means likely to be used and by reference to available data.\u201d 76 The benefit of this broad definition is that almost nothing is outside the scope of EU privacy regulation. The drawback is that information is treated as personal data, and uniformly high compliance burdens are created, irrespective of whether the data refers to an identified individual, or one who can be \u201cindirectly identified\u201d \u2013 i.e., someone who is \u201cidentifiable.\u201d This has prompted discussions on the need to create a definition of personal data based on the risk of identification, whereby data protection is triggered by the probability that the data identifies an individual. 77 The concept is especially relevant when data may be anonymised or pseudonymised to reduce the risk of identification. However, a wide definition of personal data need not necessarily give rise to onerous compliance burdens or implementation challenges if the provisions operationalising data protection principles are applied strategically and are based on identifiability. The obligations related to notification and consent, for example, may be exempted in situations where the data being processed does not directly identify individuals. Such a targeted and nuanced approach helps preserve the benefit of adopting a broad definition of personal data. Personal data being a broad and open-ended term allows for it to be interpreted widely in favour of data subjects and help",

Data controllers can choose either anonymisation or pseudonymisation based on the type of data that is being processed, the purpose of data processing, and the risk of a data breach. The process of pseudonymisation \u201cconsists of replacing one attribute (typically a unique attribute) in a record by another\u201d and is not a method of anonymisation. 98 By employing pseudonymisation, the identity of the data subject is substituted with a pseudonym, which does not disclose an individual\u2019s personal information. The pseudonym is an additional piece of information accessible only by the pseudonymising entity. It is merely a substitute and can be reversed. The re-identification would depend on additional information, such as a reference number. For example, the Internet company AOL released pseudonymised search data of its users in 2006, replacing users\u2019 names with numbers; but a simple investigation of users\u2019 search results led to the re-identification of several users, including their real",

However, the AU Convention, the HIPCAR Privacy Framework, and the OECD Guidelines refer to processors indirectly. They speak of entities undertaking processing on behalf of a controller that will duly comply with security measures. 187 The AU Convention and HIPCAR Privacy Framework make it incumbent on a controller to select a processor that can ensure a level of data protection consistent with the framework. 188 Likewise, the GDPR also requires controllers to delegate processing to processors that are able to provide data protection guarantees. 189 The GDPR clarifies that although a processor can make its own operational decisions, it must strictly adhere to the controller\u2019s instructions 190 when processing data, as well as comply with the framework. 191 The controller may provide a certain degree of discretion to the processor to choose the most suitable technical and organisational means to process the data. However, broadly speaking, the processor is required to act \u201con behalf of\u201d the controller and cannot carry out processing except as instructed by the controller. 192 When a processor goes beyond the controller\u2019s instructions and starts determining its own purposes and means of processing, it would be considered as a controller. 193 In such cases, the responsibilities and liabilities of a data controller will become applicable to the processor. Additionally, the processor may face sanctions from the controller for bypassing the controller\u2019s instructions. 194",

The EU\u2019s GDPR is a comprehensive data protection framework that has helped set new thresholds for privacy standards. Article 5 sets out the core principles that data controllers and processors are required to adopt. These principles require personal data to be: processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject; collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes it was processed for; accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed, and; processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data. The OECD Guidelines have been accepted as an international standard for personal information processing principles. The Guidelines set out the following eight principles with respect to data collection and processing: Collection Limitation \u2013 data collection should only occur with the prior knowledge and consent of the data subject. Data Quality \u2013 data controllers and processors should only collect personal data which is relevant and accurate for a particular aim. Individual Participation \u2013 the concerned individual should know if their personal data has been collected and must be able to access such collected data. Purpose Specification \u2013 the intended use for a particular piece of information must be known at the time of collection. Use Limitation \u2013 collected data must not be used for purposes other than the ones specified at the time of collection. Security Safeguards \u2013 reasonable measures must be taken to protect data from unauthorised use, destruction, modification, or disclosure of personal data. Openness \u2013 individuals should be able to establish that data collection has occurred and be able to contact the entity collecting this information. Accountability \u2013 data collectors should be held accountable for failing to abide by any of the above principles.",

    "text": "What is fairness? In general, fairness means that data controllers and processors should only handle personal data in ways that data subjects would reasonably expect and not use it in ways that could potentially have any unforeseen or adverse effects on them. For example, a default setting in software that leads to unexpected sharing of personal computer files was held to be unfair by a US court because it hindered consumer choice. 208 Similarly, the French data protection authority, la Commission nationale de l\u2019informatique et des libert\u00e9s (CNIL), sanctioned Les Pages Jaunes (Yellow Pages) for collecting information about individuals from their public social media profiles and then aggregating that information in Les Pages Jaunes\u2019 online directory service. 209 The CNIL found the processing unfair (d\u00e9loyal) because data subjects were not adequately informed that information about their public profiles would be collected by Les Pages Jaunes. They were also not given an opportunity to grant informed consent. What is lawfulness? For the processing of personal data to be lawful, data controllers and processors must identify and determine the legal bases for processing different types of data. These bases may include specific purposes and contexts of processing. Frameworks such as the GDPR specifically outline legitimate grounds for processing data which include: the consent of the data subject; the performance of a contract; the performance of a task carried out in the exercise of an authority\u2019s compliance with a legal obligation; legitimate interests of the controller or third parties; the protection of the data subject's vital interests. 210 Lawfulness also refers to the requirement that data controllers and processors comply with statutory or other legal obligations whether they be criminal or civil. For example, data controllers and processors would be required to comply with corporate filing and disclosure requirements under company law and abstain from committing offences such as fraud or forgery that are prohibited by penal statutes. What is transparency? Transparent processing of personal data means being clear, open, and honest with data subjects about which entities constitute the chain of data controllers and processors and how and why they use the personal data.",

    "text": "any subsequent changes to the uses of personal data must be communicated to the data subject prior to such use. 214 These principles assume greater importance when personal data is processed by the state or its agencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen governments use technological tools to contain the spread of infection and trace infected individuals. Many governments have justified the collection and processing of sensitive health data and other personal data as necessary to protect public health. However, this has led to the use of individuals\u2019 personal data in new and at times unexpected ways. Some countries  have resorted to emergency measures to collect data from CCTV cameras, cell phones, and credit-card transactions in order to track potentially infected persons and their movements and interactions with other people. 215 As noted by the OECD, data collection and processing efforts should preferably be authorised by law and specify how such data collection and processing will be limited to a section of the population, for a limited time period, and solely for the purpose of combatting COVID-19. 216 Adherence to the principles of fairness, lawfulness, and transparency may help mitigate these adverse impacts. For example, states and health agencies can ensure that the data collected is strictly necessary for the stated purpose of responding to a public health emergency. Crucially, the data must not be used in any manner incompatible with the purpose of a public health response. The collection and processing of this data must also be disclosed to data subjects, and the data must not be retained for longer than necessary.",

A data audit helps identify whether an organisation has effective controls, policies and procedures in place to comply with its data protection obligations. It typically involves identifying the different personal data an organisation collects, the sources for such data, the purposes for which it is collected, storage and retention practices and processing activities including third party transfers and the categories of third party recipients. The findings are then reviewed to determine whether the organisation is compliant with its data protection obligations, and if not, what needs to be done to make it compliant.

Such thresholds have been imposed by drawing upon traditional age of consent models for various activities, such as entering into contracts, having sexual relations, and undergoing medical procedures.

If it is determined that a user has provided incorrect information relating to their age, data controllers, for example, should consider means to prevent an individual from installing an application on a device which they have previously registered as an underage user. Age-verification comes with several technical, operational, and legal challenges. Nevertheless, verifying a user\u2019s age and identity does foster trust that children are protected online from age-restricted products, services or content that may be harmful to them. 529 It also provides a safer online environment where the freedom of speech and expression of a child can be supported.",

Additionally, government agendas should include the promotion of digital literacy among children, adolescents, teachers, and parents. In 2014, the Czech Republic proposed a Digital Education Strategy aimed at ensuring: non-discriminatory access to digital educational resources; conditions for development of digital skills in students and teachers; the reinforcement of educational infrastructure, and; the encouragement of the integration and understanding",

This chapter details the safeguards that are applicable to governmental access to personal data, and proceeds as follows: First principles of governmental access to personal data under international human rights law (section 7.2); Restrictions to the right to privacy and related rights must be: (i) provided for by law; (ii) not be arbitrary; (iii) pursue a legitimate aim; and (iv) be necessary and proportional to achieving such legitimate aim. Exemptions that governments can legitimately claim from data protection obligations (section 7.3); Typically, frameworks allow exemptions for: (i) national security and investigation of crimes; (ii) regulatory functions; and (iii) broader exemptions, subject to adequate data security safeguards.",

Step 2 \u2013 Does the proposed measure/data processing limit any particular right under data protection law or otherwise? Step 3 \u2013 Are the objectives of the measure defined?

Does the proposed measure achieve the objective and if yes, to what extent? Step 2 \u2013 Disadvantages: What is the scope, the extent and the gravity of limitation on the rights under data protection law?

The directive required all internet service providers (ISPs) and telecommunications service providers operating in Europe to collect and retain a subscriber's incoming and outgoing phone numbers, IP addresses, location data, and other key telecom and internet traffic data for a period of six months to two years. According to the ECJ, the \u201cretention of data for the purpose of possible access to them by the competent national authorities directly and specifically affects private life.\u201d Since such collection and retention would constitute the processing of personal data, they would have to satisfy data protection requirements. Although the objective of the Directive to fight serious crime was legitimate, the ECJ ruled that it was still not proportional because among other reasons: It required the collection of data of all persons regardless of whether their conduct had a link with a serious crime; There was no requirement for the data itself to be relevant to any serious crime, i.e. the data collected did not have to be specific to a particular time or geographical location; The Directive did not lay down any objective criterion to determine access to the collected data by national authorities. There were no substantive or procedural conditions for such access. For instance, it did not state that access must be strictly restricted to prevention and detection of precisely defined serious offences; Access by national authorities was not made dependent on a prior review by a court or independent administrative body; The data was retained for a period between 6 and 24 months, but there was no distinction made between the categories of data to be retained on the basis of their usefulness for the objectives being pursued. The Directive also did not require the mandatory destruction of the data at the end of the data retention period. The ECJ ruled that the Directive was invalid since it did not contain sufficient safeguards and was not in accordance with the principle of proportionality.",

The Court acknowledged that some of the safeguards described above are not readily applicable to mass surveillance regimes, but nevertheless noted the need for robust substantive protection to be developed for such regimes as well, informed by safeguards developed for targeted interception measures. The Court found that bulk interception, as a preventive rather than reactive measure, is unable to meet the conditions of \u201cnecessity\u201d and \u201cforeseeability.\u201d It stated \u201c\u2026when a State is operating such a [bulk interception] regime, domestic law should contain detailed rules on when the authorities may resort to such measures. In particular, domestic law should set out with sufficient clarity the grounds upon which bulk interception might be authorised and the circumstances in which an individual\u2019s communications might be intercepted.\u201d In the absence of these conditions, the ECtHR held that any bulk interception law would fall foul of Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects an individual\u2019s right to respect for their private and family life.

This system which allowed the transfer of data of EU citizens to US firms that complied with safe harbour principles. The Court found that the Safe Harbour framework did not offer equivalent protection to that in the EU. It also found that interference with fundamental rights under the Safe Harbour framework was not limited to what was strictly necessary for the purposes sought to be achieved. This was since it authorised the storage of all the personal data of all the persons whose data were transferred from the EU to the US without any differentiation, limitation or exception in the objectives pursued. That there was no objective criterion laid down for determining the limits of the access of public authorities to the data and of their subsequent use was also a contributing",

It examined the EU-US Privacy Shield, which was a legal instrument regulating the exchange of personal data between the EU and the US for commercial purposes. More than 5000 companies relied on the EU-US Privacy Shield to conduct trans-Atlantic trade. The Court found that the Shield was invalidated due to concerns of surveillance carried out by US law enforcement and government agencies. The case arose in the context of the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) permitting personal data transfers to the US among other jurisdictions. Max Schrems, the petitioner, argued that Facebook\u2019s transfers of personal data to its US headquarters could be accessed by US intelligence agencies, which, in the absence of adequate safeguards, would contravene both the GDPR and EU laws. The Court found that US law did not permit data subjects to exercise their rights before US courts and authorities. This lack of safeguards was critical to the ECJ\u2019s decision. Schrems II requires companies themselves to verify that reciprocal safeguards exist in countries to which personal data of European citizens are transferred. Despite the onerous increase in their responsibilities, the Court held that the mere presence of SCCs was insufficient to ensure protection to personal data whether they are in transit or transferred to a non-EU State.",

The OECD Guidelines define \u2018transborder flows of personal data\u2019 as \u2018movements\u2019 of personal data across \u2018national borders.\u2019 649 The Guidelines acknowledge that Member States should avoid restricting flows of personal data if the receiving country adheres to the OECD Guidelines, or if sufficient safeguards exist to ensure a continuing level of protection. 650 A similar principle allowing free cross-border flows to a country offering \u2018comparable safeguards\u2019 for privacy protection was also recognised by the United Nations General Assembly in its 1990 Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerized Personal Data Files. 651 In Europe, the regulatory origins on cross-border data flows are found in the 1981 Council of Europe\u2019s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard(s) to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, otherwise known as Convention 108. 652 As the first binding international instrument pertaining to data protection and the regulation of transborder personal data flows, Convention 108 laid down certain principles and derogations for transborder data flows among parties to the Convention. This legal instrument was modernised in 2018 with the amended instrument referred to as Convention 108+, which directs states against placing a blanket prohibition on the transborder flow of personal data for the purposes of protecting personal data. 653 Parties to the Convention are permitted to derogate in specific instances, such as when there is a risk that a transfer (to treaty-parties, or from another treaty-party to a non-Party) would",

So far, existing GDPR practice lays down an exhaustive standard to carry out adequacy assessments for non-EU countries, international organisations and other sectors. However, the GDPR permits specific and contextual transfers in cases when a nation is not deemed adequate for the purpose of blanket transfers without safeguards. Consequently, in the absence of adequacy requirements, certain industries may proceed with international transfer of personal data through a self-certification mechanism which is deemed adequate. In the context of making decisions on adequacy, the GDPR also lays down critical transparency obligations The EU-US Privacy Shield, which is no longer in for the European Commission, such as the publication, effect, is an important illustration of this mechanism. on its website, of \u2018whitelisted\u2019 third countries, sectors, Initially preceded by the \u2018Safe Harbour\u2019, personal or international organisations.

Data localisation restricts the transfer of data to third countries and these restrictions can be unconditional or conditional. Unconditional restriction means that there is a restriction in terms of the transfer of all data outside the country irrespective of the sector. This can be seen in China and Russia, where no data can be transferred outside the country. 735 While conditional restrictions limit the transfer of data based on the level of data protection in the third country, there can also be restrictions on data transfers in some sectors. For instance, personal electronic health sector data, in Australia, cannot be held or transferred to other countries. 736 Other countries (such as Vietnam) ensure that all forms of their citizen\u2019s personal data are stored locally.

Nevertheless, the general approach is to establish a supervisory authority that is responsible for enforcing the data protection legislation and related functions. The functions and powers of Regulators range from the monitoring and enforcement of the data protection framework, authorising data processing, and providing information to handling complaints relating to data protection and conducting investigations. Regardless of the specific structure, it is essential for Regulators to be designed to be autonomous, and have the resources to function effectively so that they can operate independently and transparently. The composition of regulators, access to funding and resources, and the appointment, dismissal, qualifications/ disqualifications and tenure of its members, are some factors that impact the independence of regulators. Furthermore, regulators should be accountable to multiple stakeholders, and should be able to effectively coordinate with public authorities, regulators and private organisations, as well as with other supervisory authorities. They should also be empowered to impose penalties and hold both state and private actors accountable for noncompliance with data protection laws.",

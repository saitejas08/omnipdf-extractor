Without the weights, the OPM FEVS could result in biased population estimates. While the 2022 OPM FEVS was a census, and all eligible employees had an equal probability of being selected to participate, nonresponse remains a source of potential bias in the 2022 OPM FEVS estimates. In an ideal scenario, everyone selected to participate will complete the survey. However, in practice, not everyone participates for a variety of reasons, ranging from technical issues to personal motivation. Since the OPM FEVS is voluntary, and there are cases that cannot be located (recipient is out of the office, undeliverable invites, etc.), biases can occur when some subgroups participate more or less than other subgroups. The use of weighted data attempts to account for these nonresponse biases when calculating the survey scores. Using weighted data results in statements that can be made about the Federal employee population as a whole, rather than limited to simply only those who responded to the survey.",

First, the process calculated base weights for each sampled employee equaling the reciprocal of each individual\u2019s selection probability. Second, statisticians adjusted the base weights for nonresponse within agency subgroups. Those adjustments inflate the weights of survey respondents to represent all employees in the subgroup, including non-respondents and ineligible employees. Third, statisticians used a procedure known as raking to ensure weighted distributions matched known population distributions by sex, sub- agency, and minority status within agencies. This technique can increase the precision of survey estimates. Unless otherwise noted, all 2022 OPM FEVS estimates use the full-sample weights. The full- sample weights were used to compute measures of precision by using Taylor linearization in all analyses. For statistical tests that may be conducted on Analysis on Demand (see Chapter 8), the measures of precision were computed by using replicate weights, which were developed using the Jackknife or JKn method. See Appendix E for more information on the 2022 OPM FEVS weighting processes and Appendix F for an illustration of the weight adjustment.",

There are two key elements in the OPM FEVS data that can be used to identify individuals: where the employee works, and their demographic data. The combination of these two elements is what the Public Release Data File seeks to protect, and it does so in several steps. 1. Collapses agencies and work units that do not meet a minimum number of respondents, into \u201call other\u201d categories. For 2022, we limited the work unit identifier to just the agency level, and only for agencies with at least 750 respondents. 2. Collapses categories to reduce the distinctiveness in the demographic data. For instance, collapsing the multiple age categories into a dichotomous Over/Under 40 variable helps protect the very small groups at the younger and older ends of the age groups. 3. Collapses at-risk groups into groups that are not at-risk by masking one or more of their demographic responses. For 2022, a group is considered at-risk if there are fewer than 5 respondents with the exact combination of demographics and work unit. The combination of work unit and demographics creates what is called a \u201ccell,\u201d and it allows us to identify at-risk groups. The diagram below provides a depiction of a cell and its parts:",

The first level of QC for the reports is the electronic quality control with the use of SAS\u00ae software. Two programmers create the numbers independently based on a set of pre-defined specifications and then electronically compared the numbers to ensure they matched. The second level of QC is performed by staff members who compare the input (SAS-produced results) to the output (the actual report with the data incorporated into it). While each type of report has a different QC process due to the different types of data, the general process is the same. Staff members are put into teams of two to ensure the highest level of accuracy when comparing data. One staff member reads off each number from the input data, and the other staff member reads off the number from the output data. If they match, a check mark is placed by the number. If they do not match, they inform the QC manager, who relays the error to the project manager and programmers to get it fixed. If the error is due to a problem with the code, the output data reports are re-run and the staff members go back and QC the new reports. The QC manager keeps all finished reports in a locked filing cabinet to ensure security in case there is a need to review them.",

    "text": "Dear Colleague: The 2022 Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (OPM FEVS) is administered to employees across the Federal Government. This valuable survey tool collects feedback on your experiences with your job, supervisors, leadership, workplaces and more. Ultimately, the feedback we collect is used to support improvements in your agency and to evaluate governmentwide policies and programs. Share your work experiences since the last OPM FEVS administration (November- December 2021) and be a part of changes for improvement. What\u2019s New This Year? OPM\u2019s goal for the survey is to be as responsive as possible to changing conditions that could impact employees and agencies. Since the development of the OPM FEVS in the early 2000s, workplaces have changed, and new government priorities emerged. The survey has been updated to reflect those new conditions. For example, response to the pandemic has clearly shown the importance of employee resilience, innovation, and employee involved decision-making voice to agency success. New content relevant to these and other key management topics have been added to the 2022 survey. [Redacted in response to EO 14151 Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing and EO 14168 Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government] . As we evolve our responses to the pandemic, many employees continue to work from the central worksite while others are returning after engaging in maximum telework. In recognition, several questions on the 2022 survey address ongoing responses to the pandemic and return to the worksite. Continuous improvement and responsiveness are goals of the OPM FEVS and the 2022 survey will again feature test items to assess, for example, customer experience and autonomy. As in prior years, your responses to the test questions will help in ongoing efforts to improve the value of the survey to your and to your leadership toward improving Federal workplaces. Government and Your Agency Need Your Feedback While participation in the OPM FEVS is voluntary, the importance of your feedback has increased with the addition of new content addressing key government challenges and opportunities. To support your participation, we safeguard your individual responses; they are confidential and can never be used to identify you. Agency leaderships are only provided with summary reports that combine employees\u2019 responses. We also make participation easy, and you can complete the survey during your normal work hours. It only takes about 20-30 minutes to complete \u2013 a short time to contribute toward improving your workplace! Taking the survey can be considered part of your normal duties.",

Telework : a work flexibility arrangement under which an employee performs the duties and responsibilities of such employee\u2019s position, and other authorized activities, from an approved worksite other than the location from which the employee would otherwise work. In practice, telework is a work arrangement that allows employees to have regularly scheduled days on which they telework and regularly scheduled days when they work in their agency worksite. Remote work : an arrangement in which an employee, under a written remote work agreement, is scheduled to perform their work at an alternative worksite and is not expected to perform work at an agency worksite on a regular and recurring basis. A remote worker\u2019s official worksite may be within or outside the local commuting area of an agency worksite. 91. Please select the response that BEST describes your current remote work or teleworking schedule. I have an approved remote work agreement (I am not expected to perform work at an agency worksite) [if selected will see item 91A] I telework 3 or more days per week I telework 1 or 2 days per week I telework, but only about 1 or 2 days per month I telework very infrequently, on an unscheduled or short-term basis I do not telework because I have to be physically present on the job (e.g., law enforcement officers, TSA agent, border patrol agent, security personnel) I do not telework because of technical issues (e.g., connectivity, inadequate equipment) that prevent me from teleworking I do not telework because I did not receive approval to do so, even though I have the kind of job where I can telework I do not telework because I choose not to telework The item below will only be visible if \u2018I have an approved remote work agreement\u2019 was selected for item 91 above. 91a.

Within each agency, weighting cells were constructed to group respondents and non-respondents with similar characteristics into the same cells for adjustment. The variables used to form the weighting cells included a sub-agency identifier, supervisory status, sex, minority status, age group, tenure as a Federal employee, full- or part-time status, and location (headquarters vs. field office). Large subgroups were divided into smaller weighting cells to increase variation across the cells. A categorical search algorithm was used to divide the data into smaller cells, with the goal of having response rates differ as much as possible across the cells. Cells with similar response rates were combined when necessary to achieve a minimum cell size of 30 respondents.",

The weighted counts of eligible respondents plus known ineligibles were compared with population counts for the second dimension, and the weights were adjusted again to reproduce population counts. This process of alternately adjusting for one, then the other, dimension was repeated until the survey distributions for the two dimensions equaled the population control counts for both dimensions, within a specified level of precision.

Table F3 shows how respondents can be assigned to nonresponse-adjustment cells on the basis of location and then associated response rates and nonresponse adjustment factors calculated. For example, for the Field location, the nonresponse adjustment factor would be the reciprocal of the response rate of 0.310 for a 3.226 nonresponse adjustment factor. By using the reciprocal of the response rate, the nonresponse adjustment factor will be greater than or equal to one, so multiplying the base weight for a respondent by a nonresponse adjustment factor increases it so it represents both the respondent and associated non-respondents. The base weights are then multiplied by the adjustment factors, yielding the nonresponse-adjusted weights shown in Table F4. Table F3.

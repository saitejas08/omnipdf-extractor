Step 2: From the information collected, HSAG identified common themes and the salient patterns that emerged across EQR activities for each domain and drew conclusions about overall quality, timeliness, and accessibility of health care services furnished by each CCO. Step 3: From the information collected, HSAG identified common themes and the salient patterns that emerged across all EQR activities related to strengths and opportunities for improvement in one or more of the domains of quality, timeliness, and accessibility of health care services furnished by each CCO. Step 4: HSAG identified any patterns and commonalities that exist across the program to draw conclusions about the quality, timeliness, and accessibility of health care services for the program.",

These findings include an assessment of the overall strengths and weaknesses based on the CCOs\u2019 performance as well as the degree to which the CCOs addressed the recommendations and/or findings issued during CY 2022 and unresolved findings from CY 2020 and CY 2021. The overall findings and conclusions for all plans were also compared and analyzed to develop overarching conclusions and recommendations for the Oregon managed care program.

OHA also provided clarification on State and federal rule and contract requirements to better inform the CCOs\u2019 understanding and implementation of policies, procedures, and operations. OHA has worked extensively with the CCOs to improve the quality of their provider capacity data, including ongoing technical assistance. Activities included the development of a provider specialty matrix to support the reliable and valid collection and reporting of provider network data and adequacy monitoring. OHA continued to implement, manage, and facilitate meetings and workgroups to support overall QI activities, including: monthly encounter data discussions and updates via the All Plan System Technical Workgroup, monthly QI meetings via the Quality Health Outcomes Committee, monthly regulatory meetings to review rule and contract requirements via the CCO Contracts and Compliance meeting, and monthly meetings to discuss oral health concerns via the Oral Health Forum. OHA has dedicated resources to enhance subcontractor performance monitoring and reporting. OHA and the CCOs have demonstrated continued collaboration in the development of methodologically sound designs for both statewide PIPs, and the CCOs and OHA worked to develop relevant, community-driven PIP topics through monthly statewide collaborative meetings and other statewide communications. The Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP addresses member needs identified as priorities for the state in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency (PHE). The Initiation, Engagement, and Treatment of Alcohol and Other Drug Use Disorders PIP allows the CCOs to focus plan resources on improving the treatment of members with SUD as part of the broader health care goals outlined in Oregon\u2019s 1115 SUD demonstration waiver. OHA discussed the results of the CY 2023 access and availability surveys with the CCOs and required the CCOs to use case-level data analytic files to review and correct provider directory discrepancies. In addition, OHA contracted with HSAG to conduct access and availability surveys in CY 2024 to continue monitoring the accuracy of CCO provider directory information and appointment availability. The EDV activity revealed the CCOs have the capability to collect, process, and transmit claims and encounter data to OHA in alignment with encounter data submission requirements. Overall, encounter data element omission rates were low for most evaluated elements, and a high level of element accuracy was observed for records that could be matched.",

    "text": "Program Strengths Domain(s) 1-4 OHA fully implemented a centralized deliverable tracking system to monitor the submission of deliverables required by the CCO contract. This system was created to serve as a central repository for CCO deliverable submissions and evaluations completed by OHA staff members. The Oregon managed care program continued to demonstrate compliance with federal and State requirements requiring parity between the administration of MH/SUD and M/S covered benefits. Although the evaluation identified several opportunities for improvement, results did not identify systemic issues that negatively affected parity between MH/SUD and M/S services. Rather, findings frequently highlighted general regulatory compliance issues concerning both MH/SUD and M/S benefits uniformly. Several CCOs demonstrated ongoing improvement in performance on the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits , Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes , and Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services measures since MY 2020. Program Weaknesses Domain(s) The Oregon managed care program demonstrated numerous opportunities for improvement during the CMR activity, resulting in required improvement plans to ensure corrective actions are implemented to achieve compliance with federal and State regulations. Additionally, none of the CCOs successfully resolved all of their CY 2022 CMR improvement plan findings, resulting in some CMR findings remaining noncompliant since the CY 2020 CMR audit. Although OHA developed member notice and model member handbook templates, the CCOs were not required to use the state-developed templates as required by 42 CFR \u00a7438.10(c)(4)(ii). Subsequently, the CY 2023 CMR activity identified one or more language, format, and/or content issues with member notices and member handbooks across all CCOs statewide. The Oregon managed care program was comprised of CCOs that relied heavily on multilayered, delegated arrangements to conduct core managed care functions outlined in the CCO contract. Due to the lack of sufficient oversight, numerous opportunities for improvement were identified across multiple EQR activities. The CCOs participating in Oregon\u2019s managed care program continued to experience challenges describing and demonstrating effective systems to assess and monitor the adequacy of their provider networks, including the collection and use of provider, member, and network adequacy data to drive network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. Some CCOs continued to monitor specialty providers as a single provider category rather than individual specialty types. Additionally, regional CCOs frequently reported provider networks globally limiting the assessment of provider networks available to members within specific geographic service areas. The CCOs participating in the Oregon managed care program have implemented a variety of approaches to monitoring appointment availability and using the data collected with widely varying degrees of relevance, rigor, and utility. As a result,",

    "text": "Program Weaknesses Domain(s) data are not comparable across plans and, in some cases, are of limited value to support monitoring of network adequacy by individual CCOs and the overall Oregon managed care program. In addition, findings from the CY 2023 access and availability surveys exhibited long wait times for primary care, preventive dental, and outpatient behavioral health (BH) providers for the CCOs\u2019 members. The Oregon managed care program continued to experience challenges with the quality, accuracy, and completeness of data reported across all EQR activities. Most notable data quality and accuracy issues were observed during the DSN activities related to provider capacity data, which are the same data used to populate the CCOs\u2019 provider directories. Substantial discrepancies in the provider data resulted in a high percentage of unreachable provider offices during the access and availability surveys, representing potential barriers to members seeking health care services. OHA was delayed in distributing the monthly, statewide Substance Use Disorder\u2014 Initiation, Engagement, and Treatment of Alcohol and Other Drug Use Disorders PIP indicator data affecting the CCOs\u2019 ability to conduct analyses and implement effective interventions. With a few exceptions, most CCOs failed to achieve statistically significant improvement in overall indicator results from baseline to remeasurement year (RY) 1 for the Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP.

Building upon efforts in CY 2022, OHA implemented the CCO Contract Deliverables Portal, which provided a centralized platform for the CCOs to submit, track, and review deliverable documentation and evaluation results. The CCO portal includes notifications and reminders for both CCO and OHA staff who work on coordinating deliverables. In addition, one of the highlights of the CCO Contract Deliverables Portal project is the continuous improvement cycle of review, prioritization, and implementation of system updates requested by CCO and OHA staff. This allows OHA to be responsive to changing and expanding needs. Additionally, OHA updated member notice templates and created a model member handbook. However, OHA has not fully implemented federal requirements for mandatory use of the member notices and/or model member handbook by the CCOs.

Table 3-2\u2014Protocol Activities Performed for Assessment of Compliance With Regulations Protocol Activities Steps Associated With Protocol Activities Activity 1: Establish Compliance Thresholds Conducted before the review to assess compliance with federal managed care regulations and OHA requirements: \u0336 HSAG and OHA participated in meetings to determine the timing and scope of the reviews, as well as scoring strategies. \u0336 HSAG developed and submitted the CMR Protocol, tools, and technical assistance webinar slides to OHA for review and approval. \u0336 HSAG forwarded the CMR Protocol, tools, and applicable guidance to the CCOs. \u0336 HSAG scheduled the virtual onsite reviews and distributed the detailed meeting agendas to the CCOs to facilitate preparation for the reviews. Activity 2: Perform Preliminary Review HSAG conducted a pre-review technical assistance session with the CCOs. The HSAG review team reviewed all documentation submitted prior to the virtual onsite webinar to increase its knowledge and understanding of the CCO\u2019s operations, identify areas needing clarification, and begin compiling information before the virtual onsite review. Activity 3: Conduct Virtual Onsite Review HSAG conducted an opening conference, with introductions and a review of the agenda and logistics for HSAG\u2019s one-day virtual onsite review activities. HSAG reviewed additional documents requested and made available by the CCOs during the interview sessions. HSAG reviewed the data systems used in the CCOs\u2019 operations such as utilization management (UM), care coordination, and enrollment and disenrollment. HSAG conducted interviews with the CCOs\u2019 key administrative and program staff members. HSAG conducted a closing conference during which HSAG reviewers summarized their preliminary findings, as appropriate.",

This scoring methodology is in alignment with CMS\u2019 EQR Protocol 3. HSAG compiled all submitted documentation and conducted a final review, considering the intent of the regulations, and applied a rating for each element based on the following definitions: Met indicates full compliance, defined as: \u2022 All documentation listed under a regulatory provision, or component thereof, is present; and \u2022 CCO staff provide responses to reviewers that are consistent with each other and with the documentation. Partially Met indicates partial compliance, defined as: \u2022 There is compliance with all documentation requirements, but CCO staff are unable to consistently articulate evidence of compliance during interviews; or \u2022 CCO staff can describe and verify the existence of compliant practices during the interview, but documentation is found to be incomplete or inconsistent with practice. Not Met indicates noncompliance, defined as: \u2022 No documentation is present, and staff members have minimal or no knowledge of processes or issues addressed by the regulatory provisions; or \u2022 No documentation is present and staff members have little or no knowledge of processes or issues that comply with key components (as defined by OHA) of a multi-component regulatory provision, regardless of compliance determinations for remaining, non-key components of a regulatory provision. From the scores assigned for each of the requirements, HSAG calculated a total percentage-of- compliance score for each of the four standards and an overall percentage-of-compliance score across the four standards. HSAG calculated the total score for each standard by totaling the number of Met (1 point) elements, the number of Partially Met (0.5 points) elements, and the number of Not Met (0 points) elements, then dividing the summed score by the total number of applicable elements for that standard. HSAG determined the overall percentage-of-compliance score across the areas of review by following the same method used to calculate the scores for each standard (i.e., by summing the total values of the scores and dividing the result by the total number of applicable elements).",

For each completed PIP, HSAG assessed threats to the validity and reliability of PIP findings and determined whether a PIP was not credible. To draw conclusions about the quality, timeliness, and accessibility of health care services provided by the CCOs, HSAG assigned each of the components reviewed for PIP validation to one or more of these three domains. While the focus of an CCO\u2019s PIP may have been to improve performance related to health care quality, timeliness, or accessibility, PIP validation activities were designed to evaluate the validity and quality of the CCO\u2019s process for conducting valid PIPs. Therefore, HSAG assigned all PIPs to the quality domain. In addition, all PIP topics were also assigned to other domains as appropriate. This assignment to domains is shown in Table 3-5.

To meet oversight requirements, OHA contracted with HSAG to conduct an evaluation of the CCOs\u2019 DSNs to assess network adequacy and compliance with Oregon\u2019s standards for access to care. To assess CCO compliance with State network adequacy and availability of services requirements, HSAG: \u2022 Conducted a review of the CCOs\u2019 network monitoring processes and procedures for ensuring the adequacy of its provider network, including members\u2019 access to care and the availability of services. \u2022 Assessed the CCOs\u2019 network capacity and geographic distribution of providers relative to member populations. \u2022 Evaluated, summarized, and presented aggregate findings from OHA\u2019s quarterly DSN Provider Capacity Reports . HSAG conducted the DSN Evaluation in alignment with guidance outlined in CMS\u2019 network access and adequacy toolkit 3-5 and the CMS EQR Protocols released in February. Objectives The objectives of the DSN Evaluation were to provide meaningful information to OHA and the CCOs regarding: \u2022 The CCOs\u2019 compliance with the OARs and contract requirements for monitoring CCO DSNs. \u2022 The adequacy of CCO provider networks and the CCOs\u2019 compliance with OHA-defined time and distance access standards. \u2022 The completeness and quality of CCO provider data.",

To accomplish its objectives, HSAG developed data collection tools, network adequacy summary metrics, and evaluation criteria to assess and document the CCOs\u2019 compliance with State rules and CCO contract requirements. In 2023, HSAG\u2019s evaluation included three components: \u2022 DSN Narrative Review \u2022 Network Capacity and Adequacy Assessment \u2022 DSN Provider Capacity Report Findings Technical Methods of Data Collection The key 2023 DSN Evaluation activities are described below. 1. Protocol Development and Dissemination: HSAG developed the 2023 DSN Evaluation protocol to describe the scope and methodology for conducting the DSN analysis and provide guidance to the CCOs on their participation. HSAG also developed data collection tools to support information gathering on the CCOs\u2019 network monitoring processes and procedures. \u2022 DSN Narrative Template \u2014Standardized tool the CCOs used to submit documentation of compliance with key federal and State regulations and contract requirements across four domains: DSN Governance Structure, Member Needs and Population Management, DSN Monitoring and Analysis, and Network Response Strategy. 2. DSN Technical Assistance Webinar: HSAG hosted webinar on May 16, 2023, for the CCOs to review the 2023 DSN Evaluation timeline, required documentation and submission guidelines, analysis, reporting processes, and to allow an opportunity for questions and answers. 3. Documentation Submission: The CCOs completed the 2023 DSN Narrative Template and submitted all applicable supporting documentation. All requested data and documentation were due on or before July 31, 2023. 4. Desk Review and Analysis: HSAG conducted a desk review of each organization\u2019s documentation and data to evaluate the CCOs\u2019 network adequacy and compliance with the OARs and contract requirements for monitoring DSNs. The desk review enabled HSAG reviewers to increase their knowledge and understanding of each CCO\u2019s operations, identify areas needing clarification, and begin compiling information needed to make a formal assessment. HSAG performed an analysis of the quarterly provider capacity data to assess the adequacy, availability, and timeliness of access to providers and health care services. The evaluation incorporated a multi-dimensional approach using a series of measures to support DSN reporting. HSAG also summarized findings from OHA\u2019s",

Follow-up Interviews: HSAG conducted follow-up interviews with organizations when desk review results or data analysis identified areas where additional information and/or clarification was required. 6. Report Production: HSAG compiled all information obtained from the desk review and data analysis to derive DSN findings for each CCO. HSAG summarized the results of its review and presented the findings to OHA in a draft report; the CCOs had the opportunity to review CCO- specific findings and recommendations. Upon receipt of feedback from OHA and the CCOs, HSAG drafted a final DSN Evaluation report for submission to OHA. Description of Data Obtained To assess each CCO\u2019s DSN, HSAG obtained information from multiple documents and sources completed and submitted by each organization. \u2022 CCO DSN Narrative Template and supplemental documentation used to assess compliance with OARs and CCO contract requirements. \u2022 CCO CY 2022 ISCAT used to assess the capabilities of the CCOs to collect, manage, analyze, and report provider-related data. \u2022 CCO DSN Provider Capacity Report data used in conjunction with member enrollment data to support the calculation of network adequacy metrics. \u2022 Member eligibility and enrollment files from OHA used in conjunction with DSN Provider Capacity Report data files to support the calculation of network adequacy metrics. \u2022 Unique list of members associated with MH and SUD claims in CY 2022 obtained from the CCOs\u2019 submission of the CY 2023 MHP Data Submission Template containing data used to support the CY 2023 MHP Evaluation. \u2022 OHA DSN Provider Capacity Reports used to summarize the quality of the CCOs\u2019 provider network data and the capacity of CCO provider networks . How Data Were Aggregated and Analyzed HSAG generated both qualitative and quantitative results based on submitted documentation in order to assess network adequacy during the 2023 DSN Evaluation. DSN Narrative Review In alignment with Exhibit G of the CCO contract, the DSN Narrative review assessed the CCOs\u2019 compliance with the OARs and contract requirements for monitoring CCO DSNs. Data collection relied on CCO responses and supplemental documentation collected through the 2023 DSN Narrative Template .

From the ratings assigned to each of the reporting requirements, HSAG calculated a total score for each domain. HSAG calculated the total score for each organization by totaling the number of Met (1 point) elements, the number of Partially Met (0.5 points) elements, and the number of Not Met (0 points) elements. Elements scored NA were not included in the total score. HSAG determined the overall percentage-of-compliance score across the areas of review by summing the total values of the scores and dividing the result by the total number of applicable elements. Network Capacity and Adequacy Assessment To understand the capacity and adequacy of CCO provider networks, HSAG assessed two interrelated dimensions of access: network capacity and geographic distribution. While network capacity addresses the underlying infrastructure of a provider network, geographic distribution addresses whether the distribution of available providers and services is adequate to facilitate access to all members. All analyses were limited to a subset of core individual and facility-based providers selected in collaboration with OHA to represent fundamental health services covered by the CCOs and relevant to OHA\u2019s quality strategy and network adequacy objectives.

These standards included the average travel time (in minutes) and driving distance (in miles) to the nearest provider by provider type. All study results were stratified by CCO, provider type, applicable member population, and urbanicity. Table 3-11 outlines OHA\u2019s time and distance standards.

A geographic area that is 10 or more map miles from a population center of Rural 60 Minutes 60 Miles 95% 30,000 people or less. Except where standards exist, the assessment of provider capacity and geographic distribution was used to observe key patterns associated with the structure of CCO provider networks. DSN Provider Capacity Report Findings The DSN Provider Capacity Report is an inventory of individual practitioners (i.e., physicians, mid- level practitioners, or other practitioners) and facility/service providers, whether employed by or under subcontract with a CCO, who agree to provide health care services to Medicaid CCO members. The CCOs were required to follow a reporting instruction data file template and report all required and optional demographic (e.g., name, address, identification [ID], specialty) and practice-related (e.g., hours of operation, contract status) data elements. The collection and reporting of the DSN Provider Capacity Reports was managed by OHA. OHA processed, cleaned, and evaluated the data provided by the CCOs to monitor the CCOs\u2019 DSNs and compliance with data quality and network adequacy standards. In general, OHA DSN Provider Capacity Reports included results highlighting three domains: \u2022 Quality of DSN Provider Capacity Reporting \u2014The CCO\u2019s ability to provide complete and accurate provider network data in the required format. \u2022 Provider Network Capacity \u2014The underlying infrastructure of each CCO\u2019s DSN, including whether health services are available to members through a sufficient supply and variety of providers. \u2022 Provider Accessibility \u2014The degree to which contracted services are accessible to each CCO\u2019s member population. Using OHA\u2019s quarterly DSN Provider Capacity Reports , HSAG assessed and summarized CCO performance across these three domains.",

    "text": "Quality of Provider Network Data The ability of the CCOs to collect, integrate, and report high quality provider data is critical to the ongoing monitoring and assessment of network adequacy. The completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of CCO provider data is also important in determining the accuracy of the CCOs\u2019 provider directories. Drawing upon the quarterly DSN Provider Capacity data submitted by the CCOs, OHA evaluated the quality of incoming provider data files based on the percentage of data elements that demonstrated whether: \u2022 Data values were present for required data elements, and \u2022 If present, the data were in a valid format, and \u2022 If in a valid format, the data contained valid values. HSAG aggregated and summarized OHA\u2019s findings on the quality of CCO data based on a review of key data elements using the criteria above. These results were used to assess the overall quality of the CCOs\u2019 provider data and derive a level of confidence in the data to support network adequacy monitoring. To better understand the impact of data quality, results were grouped and categorized based on importance in production of the CCOs\u2019 provider directories and general monitoring activities.

    "text": "Provider Accessibility Provider accessibility describes the degree to which contracted providers and services are accessible to CCO member populations. In alignment with prior evaluations, HSAG used OHA\u2019s DSN Provider Capacity Reports to summarize CCO performance via two measures: \u2022 The Percentage of PCPs Accepting New Members \u2022 The Number of Providers Speaking a Non-English Language The percentage of providers that accept new members serves as a key measure of members\u2019 accessibility to critical primary care and specialty health care services. For the 2023 DSN Evaluation, HSAG synthesized OHA\u2019s findings across key health care provider groups, including primary care services (physical and oral), MH and SUD providers, OB/GYN providers, and specialists. The reported categories were unweighted percentages calculated based on the number of individual practitioners within each category. The analysis also indicated, where possible, whether the change from 2022 to 2023 resulted in a substantial increase (i.e., , or 10 percentage points) or decrease (i.e., , or 10 percentage points) in the number of PCPs accepting new patients. The second measure of accessibility reflects the number of providers who speak a non-English language. Although a proxy measure for language access, this metric is useful in understanding the ability of the CCOs\u2019 provider networks to render linguistically accessible and culturally responsive services. The CCOs are required to provide qualified health care interpreter (QHCI) services and typically accomplish this via an interpretation services vendor. Beginning in 2023, OHA implemented several new accessibility performance metrics for PCPs, including the following: \u2022 Percentage of PCPs With Capacity \u2022 Percentage of Providers Within the Service Area Pending its review of the CCOs\u2019 Q1 2023 DSN Provider Capacity Reports , HSAG collaborated with OHA to summarize and report these results in the 2023 DSN Evaluation. The data presented in this analysis were used to observe and report key patterns associated with the structure of CCO provider networks. How Conclusions Were Drawn HSAG used the quality metrics to draw conclusions about data quality and the completeness of the DSN Provider Capacity Reporting data submissions. The DSN Provider Narrative responses were used to draw conclusions regarding the completeness, sufficiency, and accessibility of the provider networks. The Time and Distance Analysis was used to draw conclusions regarding the CCOs\u2019 compliance with the State\u2019s time and distance access standards.",

OHA contracted with HSAG to evaluate whether the CCOs\u2019 network providers are meeting state-established appointment availability standards. During CY 2023, HSAG conducted a secret shopper telephone survey of PCP and PCD locations contracted with one or more CCOs. A secret shopper is a person employed to pose as a client or patient to evaluate the availability of services or the validity of information (e.g., accurate location information). The secret shopper telephone survey allows for objective data collection from health care providers without potential bias introduced by knowing the identity of the surveyor. The primary purpose of the secret shopper survey was to collect appointment availability for new OHP members for routine primary care or dental services. Objectives The primary objectives of the secret shopper survey activities were to: \u2022 Determine accuracy of PCP and PCD location information (i.e., phone number and service address). \u2022 Determine whether PCP and PCD locations offered the requested services. \u2022 Determine whether PCP and PCD locations accepted the CCO. \u2022 Determine whether the service locations accepted OHP. \u2022 Determine whether the PCP and PCD locations accepted new patients. \u2022 Determine appointment availability for primary care visits and routine dental at PCP and PCD locations, respectively.",

The data included the following fields for use in the secret shopper study: \u2022 Demographics (e.g., provider\u2019s NPI, Division of Medical Assistance Programs ID (DMAP ID), name, address, county, and phone number) \u2022 Provider taxonomy \u2022 Service area indicator \u2022 Provider participation status \u2022 Provider new patient acceptance status Upon receipt of the aggregated network provider data from OHA, HSAG reviewed key data fields to assess potential duplication and completeness. Key data fields included, but were not limited to, service telephone number, service street address, provider name, provider NPI, DMAP ID, service area indicator, PCP indicator, and new patient acceptance indicator. Following HSAG\u2019s review of the DSN Provider Capacity Report data, HSAG collaborated with OHA to determine whether geographic restrictions were required. HSAG then used the criteria noted in Table 3-15 or an indicator (i.e., PCP_Ind = \u201cY\u201d) to identify PCPs and PCDs for CCOs. 3-6 Table 3-15\u2014PCP and PCD Identification Criteria for CCOs Display Name Taxonomy Code Primary Care Providers FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN 207Q00000X ADOLESCENT MEDICINE (FAMILY MEDICINE) PHYSICIAN 207QA0000X ADULT MEDICINE PHYSICIAN 207QA0505X GERIATRIC MEDICINE (FAMILY MEDICINE) PHYSICIAN 207QG0300X GENERAL PRACTICE PHYSICIAN 208D00000X",

HSAG aggregated individual practitioner records into location-based cases. \u2013 To minimize duplicated provider records within each CCO, HSAG standardized the providers\u2019 address data to align with the United States Postal Service Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS). Address standardization did not affect the survey population; provider records requiring address standardization remained in the eligible population. The original provider address data values were retained for locations where potential CASS address changes may have impacted data validity (e.g., the address was standardized to a different city or county). \u2013 Service locations that did not accept new patients were excluded from the sample frame. New patient acceptance was identified from an indicator (i.e., Accept_Ind = \u201cY\u201d or missing) in the CCOs\u2019 DSN Provider Capacity Reports . \u2013 Service locations that did not accept patients for routine primary care or dental services (e.g., hospitalists that only see patients at a hospital) were excluded from the sample frame. Out-of- service locations identified as bordering Oregon in California, Idaho, Washington, and Nevada were included in the sample frame. \u2022 Step 2: HSAG used the sample frame to determine the number of unique provider locations. In order to minimize the number of repeat phone calls to providers, HSAG identified locations based on unique phone numbers. If a phone number was associated with multiple addresses across CCOs,",

How Data Were Aggregated and Analyzed Telephone Survey Process Trained interviewers collected survey responses using a standardized script approved by OHA. Callers were instructed to conduct the survey as though they are moving to the area and trying to arrange an appointment for themselves or a family member. Survey callers requested appointment availability for only the sampled location. Due to the secret shopper nature of the calls, callers improvised during actual calls as needed. Callers were instructed not to leave voicemail messages or schedule appointments. HSAG interviewers made two attempts to contact each survey case during standard business hours (i.e., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time [PDT]). 3-7 If put on hold at any point during the call, the caller waited on hold for five minutes before ending the call. If a call attempt was answered by an answering service or voicemail during normal business hours, the caller made a second call attempt on a different day and at a different time of day. A survey case was considered nonresponsive if any of the following criteria were met: \u2022 Disconnected/invalid telephone number (e.g., the telephone number in the CCO\u2019s data file connected to a fax line or a message that the number was no longer in service). \u2022 Telephone number connected to an individual or business unrelated to a medical practice or facility. \u2022 The caller was unable to speak with office personnel during either call attempt (e.g., the call went to voicemail or answering service that prevented the interviewer from speaking with office staff members). Interviewers received project-specific training with a dedicated HSAG analytics manager to standardize caller outreach, and data were captured in a web-based data collection tool.

    "text": "Sampling Strategy The following random sampling approach was used to generate a list of outpatient BH service locations (i.e., \u201ccases\u201d) from each CCO for inclusion in the survey: \u2022 Step 1: HSAG assembled the sample frame using records from all outpatient BH service locations identified by each CCO. HSAG aggregated individual practitioner records into location-based cases. \u2013 To minimize duplicated provider records within each CCO, HSAG standardized the providers\u2019 address data to align with the United States Postal Service CASS. Address standardization did not affect the survey population; provider records requiring address standardization remained in the eligible population. The original provider address data values were retained for locations where potential CASS address changes may have impacted data validity (e.g., the address was standardized to a different city or county). \u2013 Service locations that did not accept new patients were excluded from the sample frame. New patient acceptance was identified from an indicator (i.e., Accept_Ind = \u201cY\u201d) in the CCOs\u2019 DSN Provider Capacity Reports . Out-of-service locations identified as bordering Oregon in California, Idaho, Washington, and Nevada were included in the sample frame. \u2013 Service locations that did not accept patients for outpatient BH services (e.g., hospitalists that only see patients at a hospital) were excluded from the sample frame. \u2022 Step 2: HSAG used the sample frame to determine the number of unique provider locations. In order to minimize the number of repeat phone calls to providers, HSAG identified locations based on unique phone numbers. If a phone number was associated with multiple addresses across CCOs, HSAG randomly assigned the number to a single CCO and standardized address, prioritizing assignment to the least represented CCOs. Description of Data Obtained Data obtained from OHA included: \u2022 CCO DSN Provider Capacity Report data. \u2022 Responses to survey questions collected during revealed telephone survey calls. How Data Were Aggregated and Analyzed Telephone Survey Process Trained interviewers collected survey responses using a standardized script approved by OHA and interviewers were instructed not to schedule actual appointments. Interviewers contacted each telephone number (\u201ccase\u201d), abstracting data into a web-based data collection tool. 3-8",

    "text": "HSAG interviewers made two attempts to contact each survey case during standard business hours (i.e., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PDT). 3-9 If put on hold at any point during the call, the caller waited on hold for five minutes before ending the call. If a call attempt was answered by an answering service or voicemail during normal business hours, the caller made a second call attempt on a different day and at a different time of day. A survey case was considered nonresponsive if any of the following criteria were met: \u2022 Disconnected/invalid telephone number (e.g., the telephone number in the CCO\u2019s data file connected to a fax line or a message that the number was no longer in service). \u2022 Telephone number connected to an individual or business unrelated to a medical practice or facility. \u2022 The caller was unable to speak with office personnel during either call attempt (e.g., the call went to voicemail or answering service that prevented the interviewer from speaking with office staff members). Interviewers received project-specific training with a dedicated HSAG analytics manager to standardize caller outreach, and data were captured in a web-based data collection tool. To aid in abstraction, the data collection tool controlled skip logic between survey elements. HSAG conducted oversight of the calls to verify callers were using the web-based tool and script as intended and that survey data were accurately documented in the web-based tool. Data inconsistencies identified in the data collection tool resulted in follow-up with the original caller by the HSAG analytics manager. If necessary, callers contacted the service location to resolve any potential data issues. When situations occurred where the issue could not be resolved through internal discussion or follow-up, HSAG contacted OHA for guidance (e.g., systematically incorrect telephone numbers for a CCO or group of practices). Survey Indicators HSAG classified survey indicators into two domains: provider data accuracy and appointment availability. Provider data accuracy was evaluated based on whether demographic information from the provider capacity data matched survey responses. For data collected on the first available appointment, the average wait time was calculated based on the date of the completed revealed shopper call and earliest appointment date. HSAG collected the following information pertaining to provider data accuracy: \u2022 Telephone number \u2022 Address \u2022 Provider location\u2019s services",

HSAG\u2019s approach to conducting EDV studies is tailored to address the specific needs of its clients by customizing elements outlined in and in alignment with CMS\u2019 EQR Protocol 5 . Validation of Encounter Data Reported by the Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Plan: An Optional EQR-Related Activity , February 2023 (EQR Protocol 5). 3-10 For CY 2023, the EDV study focused on the CCOs\u2019 delegated subcontractors responsible for the administration, payment, and processing of dental claims. HSAG conducted the following activities for the EDV study: \u2022 Targeted assessment of encounter data information systems and processes\u2014administered a targeted questionnaire to gather information on the CCOs\u2019 and their subcontractors\u2019 information systems to assess their ability to promote and maintain quality encounter data. This activity corresponds to Activity 2: Review the MCO\u2019s Capability in CMS\u2019 EQR Protocol 5. \u2022 Comparative analysis\u2014conducted an analysis of OHA\u2019s dental encounter data completeness and accuracy by comparing OHA\u2019s electronic dental encounter data and the data extracted from the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors\u2019 data systems. This activity corresponds to Activity 3: Analyze Electronic Encounter Data in CMS\u2019 EQR Protocol 5.",

    "text": "Targeted Assessment of Encounter Data Information Systems and Processes HSAG understands that the CCOs contracted with dental subcontractors to collect, process, and submit dental encounter data to OHA. As such, HSAG gathered information on the CCOs\u2019 and their subcontractors\u2019 information systems to assess their ability to promote and maintain high-quality dental encounter data. To ensure the collection of critical information, HSAG developed a customized questionnaire to gather information regarding each organization\u2019s information systems and data processing procedures. After receiving the completed questionnaires from the CCOs and their vendors, HSAG conducted further follow-up via emails or meetings, as necessary, to clarify any questions from the questionnaire responses. Comparative Analysis The goal of the comparative analysis was to evaluate the extent to which dental encounters submitted to OHA by the CCOs, directly or indirectly, via their subcontractors were complete and accurate, based on corresponding information stored in the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors\u2019 claims data systems. The dental encounter data were considered complete if the data reflected all services rendered to members, and all data within the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors\u2019 data systems had been submitted and successfully imported into OHA\u2019s data system. For dental encounter data to be considered accurate, the data that the CCOs and their subcontractors maintained must represent the actual services rendered; when they were rendered (i.e., the date of service); to whom they were rendered (i.e., the member); by whom they were rendered (i.e., the provider); and, if a payment was rendered in connection to the service, how much was paid. HSAG developed data submission requirements documents to request dental encounter/claims data from both OHA and the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors. These documents included a brief description of the EDV study, a description of the review period, specifications of the dental claims/encounter data, required data fields, and procedures for submitting the requested data files to HSAG. OHA and the CCOs\u2019 dental subcontractors were requested to submit dental claims and encounters with dates of service from January 1, 2022 , through December 31, 2022 , and only to include dental claims and encounters that were in a final, fully adjudicated status as of May 31, 2023.",

Of note, the CCOs were responsible for coordinating with their subcontractors to extract the requested data. The technical assistance webinar occurred approximately one week after distributing the data requirements documents, allowing the CCOs time to review and prepare their questions in advance of the meeting. During the technical assistance webinar, HSAG\u2019s EDV team introduced the EDV study, reviewed the data submission requirements documents, and addressed questions related to data preparation and extraction. The CCOs and their subcontractors were given 90 days to extract and prepare the requested files for submission to HSAG. Following receipt of OHA\u2019s and the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors\u2019 data submissions, HSAG conducted a preliminary file review to determine if any data issues existed in the data files that would warrant a resubmission. The preliminary file review included the following basic data quality checks: \u2022 Data extraction\u2014Extracted based on the data requirements document. \u2022 Percentage present\u2014Required data fields are present on the file and have values in those fields. \u2022 Percentage of valid values\u2014The values are the expected values (e.g., valid Current Dental Terminology [CDT] codes in the procedure code field). \u2022 Evaluation of matching claim numbers\u2014The percentage of claim numbers matching between the data submitted by OHA and the data submitted by the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors to HSAG.

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) governs how MH/SUD treatments delivered by MCOs and limitations on MH/SUD benefits must be comparable to and applied no more stringently than the limitations applied to M/S benefits. Provisions of the MHPAEA became applicable to OHP in October 2017 when the Medicaid Parity Final Rule (42 CFR \u00a7438 Subpart K) went into effect. The rule requires parity in the following key areas: \u2022 Aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits (AL/ADLs). \u2022 Financial requirements (FRs\u2014such as copays). \u2022 Quantitative treatment limitations (QTLs\u2014such as day and visit limits). \u2022 Non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs\u2014such as prior authorization [PA] and provider network admission requirements). Additional MHP regulations require that criteria for medical necessity determinations for MH/SUD benefits must be made available to beneficiaries and providers upon request, as well as the reason for denial of reimbursement or payment for MH/SUD benefits. States must also implement monitoring procedures to ensure continued compliance and to identify when changes in benefit design or operations could affect compliance and require an updated analysis. Finally, Oregon House Bill 3046 (HB 3046), enrolled in 2021 and effective in 2022, outlined additional MHP reporting requirements for CCOs and OHP FFS, culminating in the presentation of a comprehensive report to the Oregon Legislature annually. To comply with federal and State requirements, OHA contracted with its EQRO, HSAG, to conduct an evaluation of parity for MH/SUD benefits as relative to M/S benefits provided under OHP managed care benefit packages in accordance with requirements in 42 CFR \u00a7438, Subpart K and Oregon HB 3046. The 2023 analysis included a review of each CCO\u2019s and OHP FFS\u2019 treatment limitations used by the organization to manage MH/SUD and M/S benefits to ensure compliance with MHP requirements, a review of claims and UM data to identify key patterns and outcomes associated with the administration of covered benefits, a file review targeting service authorization denials and appeals to ensure accurate implementation of policies and procedures, and an evaluation of the adequacy of the provider network and timeliness of access to MH/SUD treatment and services. For the purposes of this annual EQR technical report, only the CCO-specific methodology and results are presented.",

MHP Technical Assistance Webinar: HSAG conducted a webinar to provide an overview of MHP regulations; details of the 2023 MHP Analysis Protocol and tools; an overview of the MHP Analysis timeline; a review of required documentation and submission guidelines, analysis, and reporting processes; and an opportunity for questions and answers. HSAG and OHA produced a Questions & Answers document to provide clarification to the CCOs on any questions received during and after the webinar. 4. Documentation Submission: The CCOs were required to submit the MHP Treatment Limitation Review Tool and all applicable supporting documentation, as well as submit claims, UM, and credentialing data through the MHP Data Submission Template . 5. Desk Review and Analysis: HSAG conducted a desk review of each CCO\u2019s submitted documentation and data to evaluate parity between MH/SUD and M/S services and benefits. HSAG performed an analysis of the claims, UM, and credentialing data to assess the impact of MH/SUD and M/S operations on claims and utilization decisions. Reported rates were validated against member level detail files and used to develop an administrative profile of each CCO. HSAG completed a file review of MH/SUD and M/S service authorization denials and appeals to further understand UM decision details and their impact on parity. HSAG also performed an assessment of the CCOs\u2019 MH/SUD provider networks to assess the adequacy, availability, and timeliness of access to MH/SUD services. The evaluation incorporated a multi-dimensional approach using a series of measures to support MHP reporting. \u2013 Follow-up Inquiries: HSAG conducted follow-up with each CCO when desk review results or data analysis identified areas that required additional information and/or clarification. 6. Report Production: HSAG compiled the preliminary results from all information obtained for each CCO. Per HB 3046, HSAG summarized the results of its review and presented the findings to OHA and its CPs to solicit input on the assessment of the CCOs\u2019 compliance with the requirement for parity between MH/SUD and M/S covered benefits, identifying areas in which MHP was not achieved and corrective actions were required to ensure future parity. HSAG received feedback from OHA and its CPs and drafted a final MHP Evaluation report for submission to OHA and the Oregon Legislature, no later than December 31, 2023.",

From the ratings assigned to each of the limitations identified, HSAG calculated a total compliance score for each applicable treatment limitation. HSAG calculated the total score for each organization by totaling the number of Compliant (1 point) elements, the number of Partially Compliant (0.5 points) elements, and the number of Not Compliant (0 points) elements. Elements Not Applicable to the organization are scored NA and are not included in the total score. Administrative Data Profiles To further understand the impact of CCO policies and procedures on the management of MH/SUD and M/S benefits, HSAG analyzed CCO data collected between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, across three key domains. The data included aggregate counts for claims/encounters and UM decisions for MH/SUD and M/S services as well as MH/SUD provider enrollment data and identification of members representing the MH, SUD, and M/S claims. HSAG reviewed all submitted data for consistency and conducted a comparative analysis to identify trends between MH/SUD and M/S services, between CCOs and statewide. Data collected to support the Administrative Data Profiles included services covered through four OHP benefit packages 3-13 (i.e., CCOA, CCOB, CCOE, and CCOB). Although descriptive, the Administrative Data Profile was used to observe key patterns and outcomes associated with the administration of MH/SUD and M/S covered benefits.

Using CCO data captured in OHA\u2019s quarterly DSN Provider Capacity Reports , HSAG aggregated the data and reported two core metrics: \u2022 Provider Counts\u2014The number and percentage of MH and SUD providers. \u2022 Provider-to-Member Ratios\u2014The ratio of MH and SUD providers to members with at least one MH/SUD claim during the measurement year. Time and Distance HSAG assessed the geographic distribution of MH and SUD providers relative to member populations as represented by the percentage of members having access to an MH and SUD provider within the OHA-defined time and distance standards. These standards included the average travel time (in minutes) and driving distance (in miles) to the nearest provider for each type of provider.

None of the CCOs received a high confidence level. \u2022 Individual CCO compliance scores ranged from 44.4 percent to 94.4 percent (Standard III\u2014 Coordination and Continuity of Care), 44.4 percent to 86.1 percent (Standard IV\u2014Coverage and Authorization of Services), 50 percent to 90 percent (Standard VII\u2014Member Rights and Protections), 77.8 percent to 92.6 percent (Standard X\u2014Grievance and Appeal Systems), and 65.9 percent to 93.2 percent (Standard XIV\u2014Member Information). \u2022 Three CCOs (TCHP-North, TCHP-South, and UHA) achieved full compliance (100 percent) in Standard XVI\u2014Emergency and Poststabilization Services. \u2022 AH and UHA performed at least 10 percentage points higher than the remaining CCOs, both receiving scores of 90.0 percent in Standard VII\u2014Member Rights and Protections. \u2022 UHA performed at or above the highest CCO individual compliance scores for all six standards reviewed, and its overall compliance score of 92.5 percent was 12.3 percentage points above the overall statewide CCO compliance rate. \u2022 Health Share performed below all the CCOs in four of the six standards reviewed, with three of the four individual compliance scores and the CCO\u2019s overall compliance score falling at least 10 percentage points lower than the remaining CCOs.

See Appendix B for comparative CMR scores from CY 2020 to CY 2023. \u2022 All CCOs were required to develop an improvement plan based on the CY 2023 compliance review. For the CCOs statewide, the most frequent opportunities for improvement were the following: \u2022 Lack of operational structures and failure to implement effective systems to review, approve, or deny authorization requests, including the utilization of decision-makers with the appropriate level of expertise. \u2022 Failure to consult requesting providers prior to rendering coverage decisions then overturning the denial decision following a conversation and additional documentation obtained from the requesting provider. Although not required, HSAG noted the CCOs at large were also not utilizing extensions to obtain the necessary documentation to support coverage decisions. \u2022 Lack of sufficient oversight and monitoring of subcontractors. Most CCOs delegated coverage and authorization of services and care coordination responsibilities to one or more subcontractors who may, in turn, sub-delegate to a downstream entity. Subcontractors were often unable to demonstrate systems used to manage such responsibilities or demonstrate compliance with federal and State requirements. In most cases, the CCO relied on reviews of the subcontractor\u2019s policies and procedures or attestations when conducting oversight activities rather than monitoring the subcontractors\u2019 actual performance. This included a failure to review and ensure subcontractors were complying with language, format, and content requirements for notice of adverse benefit determination (NOABDs).",

HSAG identified instances in which the CCOs denied emergency and poststabilization services due to the provider not obtaining PA or as a result of a retrospective review. \u2022 Failure to resolve findings from CY 2020 through CY 2022 CMR activities. All CCOs had unresolved findings following HSAG\u2019s assessment of the CCOs\u2019 improvement plans during the CY 2023 CMR activity. The number of unresolved findings ranged from one each for PCS-CO, PCS-CG, PCS-Lane, and PCS-MP to 23 for Health Share. Four CCOs (EOCCO, Health Share, IHN, and YCCO) continued to have unresolved findings from the CY 2020 review, and all CCOs, with the exception of EOCCO, had at least one unresolved finding from the CY 2021 review. See Appendix C for the summary of unresolved compliance review findings from the past three reporting cycles. For the CCOs statewide, the most common required actions and recommendations assigned were the following: \u2022 Revise policies, procedures, and member and provider communications to align with federal and State requirements. \u2022 Evaluate and revise current processes, as necessary, to ensure compliance with federal and State requirements with coordination and continuity of care, coverage and authorization of services, member rights and protections, grievance and appeal systems, emergency and poststabilization services, and member information standards. \u2022 Implement appropriate oversight of subcontractors and their processes and materials to ensure adherence to federal and State requirements. \u2022 Review the most recent versions of the notice templates to ensure minimum federal and State requirements are captured, discuss any omissions found in the template with OHA, and ensure implementation of the appropriate version of all templates at the CCO and subcontractor levels, as compliance will be assessed during the subsequent compliance review for the standards reviewed.",

For the CCOs statewide, the following opportunities for improvement were identified: \u2022 Three CCOs received an overall Partially Met validation status (i.e., TCHP-South and YCCO\u2014 Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP and JCC \u2014Initiation, Engagement, and Treatment of Alcohol and Other Drug Use Disorders PIP) for reporting indicator results in their PIP submission forms that differed from the final indicator data that OHA provided to the CCOs and HSAG within Step 7: Data Analysis and Interpretation of Results. \u2022 Only four of 16 CCOs (i.e., AH, AllCare, Health Share, and UHA) reported statistically significant improvement of overall indicator results from baseline to RY 1 for the Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP . \u2022 Three CCOs (i.e., CHA, CPCCO, and JCC) did not provide any documentation in their Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP submission forms related to the assessment of significant clinical or programmatic improvement. To facilitate meaningful improvement of accurate data analyses and interpretations for the CCOs statewide, the following recommendations were identified: \u2022 OHA and the CCOs should continue its collaborative relationship and work together to identify barriers to improving access to MH services and SUD treatment for members with an identified need. \u2022 The CCOs should ensure a clear understanding of the performance indicator data files received from OHA so that progress toward improvement goals can be effectively assessed and reported throughout the duration of the project. The CCOs should reach out to OHA for clarification on data files, if needed. \u2022 The CCOs should review and ensure internal communication processes exist to receive monthly data distribution notifications from OHA. The CCOs should also use monthly indicator data results to evaluate progress on improving performance throughout the measurement year in relation to interventions being conducted. The monthly data files should inform the CCOs of whether their current interventions are having a positive impact on performance, prior to the end of the",

The performance of six CCOs (CHA, Health Share, IHN, JCC, PCS-Lane, and PCS-MP) declined in MY 2022 compared to MY 2021. Two CCOs (Health Share and IHN) demonstrated a decline in performance from MY 2021 to MY 2022 despite having MY 2022 rates that were greater than the statewide aggregate rate. One CCO (JCC) demonstrated a substantial decline in its rate from MY 2021 to MY 2022 (-5.7 percentage points). The performance of four CCOs (PCS-CO, PCS-CG, UHA, and YCCO) improved in MY 2022 compared to MY 2021. All four CCOs had MY 2022 rates that were substantially greater than the statewide aggregate rate. One CCO (UHA) demonstrated a substantial improvement in its rate from MY 2021 to MY 2022 (5.9 percentage points). Additionally, seven CCOs (AH, EOCCO, PCS-CO, PCS-CG, TCHP-South, UHA, and YCCO) demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020. \u2022 For the Initiation and Engagement of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment measure, HSAG did not compare MY 2022 rates to rates from previous measurement years due to the NCQA- recommended break in trending because of major changes to the measure\u2019s specifications. Among members ages 13 to 17 years, four CCOs (CPCCO, PCS-CG, PCS-Lane, and UHA) had MY 2022 rates that were substantially greater than the statewide aggregate rate on the Initiation of SUD Treatment measure indicator. Additionally, five CCOs (CHA, CPCCO, PCS-CG, TCHP-North, and UHA) had MY 2022 rates that were substantially greater than the statewide aggregate rate on the Engagement of SUD Treatment measure indicator. Three CCOs (CPCCO, PCS-CG, and UHA) performed substantially better than the statewide aggregate on both indicators for members ages 13 to 17 years. Among members ages 18 years and older, one CCO (PCS-Lane) had an MY 2022 rate that was substantially greater than the statewide aggregate rate and OHA benchmark on the Initiation of SUD Treatment measure indicator, and another CCO (CHA) had an MY 2022 rate substantially greater than the statewide aggregate rate and OHA benchmark on the Engagement of SUD Treatment measure indicator. Three CCOs (AH, AllCare, and CPCCO) performed below the OHA benchmark on both indicators for members ages 18 years and older. \u2022 The statewide CCO performance on the Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services measure demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020 for members ages 1 to 5 and 6 to 14 years. For members ages 1 to 5 years, four CCOs (AH, AllCare, JCC, and TCHP-North) demonstrated substantial improvements in their rates from MY 2021 to MY 2022. With the exception of PCS-CG, all CCOs demonstrated improvement in their rates from MY 2021 to MY 2022 for members ages 6 to 14 years, with 10 of those CCOs showing substantial improvement. \u2022 Statewide, there was little change in the statewide CCO performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure from MY 2021 to MY 2022 (-0.1 percentage points). One CCO (PCS- CG) continued its strong performance on the measure, with three consecutive years of rates substantially greater than the statewide aggregate rate; however, the CCO also demonstrated a decline in its rate from MY 2021 to MY 2022. Five additional CCOs (CPCCO, Health Share, PCS- CO, UHA, and YCCO) demonstrated an MY 2022 rate that was greater than the statewide aggregate rate.

The performance of one of these six CCOs (JCC) decreased by nearly 6 percentage points (-5.7 percentage points) between MY 2021 and MY 2022, although the CCO had substantially improved its performance on this measure in MY 2021 compared to MY 2020 (9.1 percentage points). Additionally, CHA continued its downward trend in performance on this measure from MY 2020 to MY 2022. \u2022 The statewide CCO performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure declined slightly (0.1 percent) between MY 2021 and MY 2022. Six CCOs demonstrated a decline between MY 2021 and MY 2022, including two CCOs (Health Share and PCS-CG) that demonstrated a substantial improvement in rates between MY 2020 and MY 2021 (6.7 percentage points and 6.3 percentage points, respectively) but declined in performance in MY 2022 (-1.3 percentage points and -2.9 percentage points, respectively). For the CCOs statewide, the following recommendations were identified: \u2022 The statewide CCO decline in performance on the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits measure suggests that fewer eligible members (i.e., children ages 3 to 6 years) had a well-care visit with a PCP in MY 2022 compared to MY 2021. HSAG recommends that the CCOs whose performance declined in MY 2022 conduct a root cause analysis to identify the member, provider, or operational factors affecting their performance on this measure. Based on the results of this review, the CCOs should design, implement, and assess appropriate interventions to improve the delivery of services to children. \u2022 Although most CCOs demonstrated ongoing improvement in performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure between MY 2021 and MY 2022, the decline in performance for the remaining CCOs suggests potential challenges providing oral evaluations to adult members with diabetes in MY 2022. HSAG recommends that the CCOs whose performance declined in MY 2022 conduct a root cause analysis to identify the member, provider, or operational factors affecting their performance on this measure. Based on the results of this review, the CCOs should design, implement, and assess appropriate interventions to improve the delivery of services to adults. \u2022 HSAG recommends all CCOs performing below the OHA benchmarks set for the Initiation and Engagement of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment measure indicators for MY 2022 conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted.

    "text": "Provider-to-Member Ratios HSAG calculated CCO-specific provider-to-member ratios for all provider types 4-3 in order to standardize the reporting of provider capacity. The provider-to-member ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of members enrolled in each CCO by the total number of providers within the CCO\u2019s network. The number of members enrolled in each CCO was determined by extracting members from the OHA enrollment and eligibility files who were active with the CCO as of March 31, 2023. HSAG applied member restrictions when calculating the provider-to-member ratios for MH and SUD providers based on the number of members with at least one IP or OP claim with an MH or SUD diagnosis during CY 2022. 4-4 This metric serves as a way to standardize estimations of a CCO\u2019s provider network as it accounts for service area and membership size. Since OHA does not currently have specific provider-to- member ratio standards for any provider type, the results below are presented for informational purposes. Table 4-16 shows the provider-to-member ratios for PCPs stratified by the adult, pediatric, and total member populations.

A Moderate level of confidence reflects CCO performance with at least one quality metric less than 99 percent, but all results greater than or equal to 95 percent, and are shaded yellow. A Low level of confidence was assigned if one or more data quality metric fell below 95 percent, and are shaded red.

In some cases, these limitations, or conditions, must be met to schedule an appointment but did not prevent the caller from documenting the first available appointment. Conditional factors limiting the scheduling of appointments included, but were not limited to, the following: \u2022 Pre-registration requirements or providing personal information. \u2022 Medicaid eligibility verification. \u2022 Completion of questionnaire/interview. \u2022 Requiring a review of member\u2019s medical record or initial evaluation. \u2022 The unavailability of office location schedule or calendar. \u2022 Requiring patients to live in a particular area. \u2022 Limiting appointments to specific age groups. Office locations may have applied multiple requirements and limitations that affected members\u2019 access to care, including the ability to obtain appointment availability. The most prevalent factors reported by survey respondents were requiring members to pre-register or provide personal information (154 office locations), the scheduling calendar being unavailable (44 office locations), and completion of a questionnaire or interview (28 office locations). Appointment Wait Times The CCOs must have policies and procedures in place to ensure the scheduling of appointments is reasonable.

    "text": "For the CCOs statewide, the following conclusions were made: Delivery System Network Evaluation \u2022 Based on HSAG\u2019s review of the DSN Provider Narrative submissions, the CCOs\u2019 level of compliance with the State requirements varied by the CCOs\u2019 monitoring and reporting of the adequacy of their provider networks. Statewide, the CCOs exhibited compliance with 86.5 percent of elements across the four provider narrative domains with individual category compliance ranging from 82.8 percent ( DSN Monitoring and Analysis ) to 98.5 percent ( DSN Governance Structure ). \u2022 Overall, nearly two-thirds of the CCOs showed substantial changes in PCP counts between 2022 and 2023. However, caution should be used when interpreting these results due to changes made by OHA in its data collection and the CCOs\u2019 reporting of provider capacity data. Since 2022, OHA worked extensively with the CCOs to improve the quality of their data, including the use of the National Uniform Claim Committee health care provider taxonomy code to define areas of specialty and reliance on the PCP indicator (PCP_Ind) data field to define PCPs. As such, changes in PCP counts likely reflect improved data quality and methodology updates rather than an actual increase or decrease in contracted PCPs within the CCOs\u2019 networks. \u2022 The dental provider network reported by the CCOs in 2023 remained stable with a few exceptions (i.e., AllCare, CHA, CPCCO, IHN, and UHA). AllCare showed a substantial increase in PCDs from one to 45 providers in 2023; however, this change was likely due to improvement in the accuracy and completeness of provider data rather than an actual change in its network, as AllCare did not provide sufficient PCD data for the CY 2022 DSN Evaluation. CHA and UHA showed substantial changes, but these changes were due to relatively small provider pools (i.e., differences of four and seven PCDs, respectively). IHN showed a substantial increase in PCDs that was likely due to additional contracting. Conversely, CPCCO showed a substantial decrease in PCDs (i.e., 70 PCDs, or a quarter of its 2022 network). Within its DSN Provider Narrative Template, CPCCO noted a workforce shortage for PCDs within its service areas and stated it was offering incentive programs and working with national recruiters to improve access to oral health care services. However, dental workforce shortages have been observed statewide, and it was unclear from the results why CPCCO demonstrated a larger decrease compared to other CCOs with greater membership (e.g., Health Share) and/or equally rural service areas (e.g., PCS). \u2022 Between 2022 and 2023, the CCOs showed substantial increases in MH provider counts across the board with few decreases. Several factors likely contributed to these increases, including efforts by the CCOs to increase enrollment and contracting with MH providers in response to members\u2019 needs as well as improvements to the quality of provider data and changes in study protocols (e.g., provider categorization). However, caution should be used when interpreting the results, as some CCOs report provider network capacity data at an enterprise level, which may increase the overall number of providers regardless of location and/or availability to Medicaid members. This situation is often identified with CCOs managing multiple service areas or with extensive delegated services (e.g., PCS, TCHP, and Health Share). Additionally, PCS reported a somewhat higher percentage of",

Most CCOs responded with some level of increase in SUD provider networks, with seven CCOs (i.e., AH, AllCare, Health Share, IHN, TCHP-S, UHA, and YCCO) showing substantial increases in the number of contracted SUD providers. The reported increase in providers was likely due to efforts by the CCOs to increase enrollment of SUD providers, as well as general improvement in the completeness and quality of the CCOs\u2019 provider data. One CCO, EOCCO, exhibited a substantial decrease (13.4 percent, or 45 providers). Further analysis of the CCO\u2019s data showed that the decrease was driven by losses in SUD providers serving pediatric members. However, this finding likely reflected a data quality issue as EOCCO reported nearly all its providers as exclusively serving either adult or pediatric populations, with few providers documented as serving both adults and children. Additionally, several CCOs reported a comparatively small numbers of providers (i.e., AH and CHA), which may also impact reported changes in rates. As such, caution should be used when interpreting these results. \u2022 Overall, provider-to-member ratios for both MH and SUD providers were low, indicating the CCOs had a large number of providers contracted to perform MH and SUD services relative to members with an MH or SUD diagnosis. However, this does not mean that members had greater access to MH and SUD providers compared to other provider types (e.g., PCPs, specialty providers). While provider-to-member ratios are not indicative of network adequacy in and of themselves, and Oregon has not adopted minimum provider-to-member ratio standards, they serve as useful general trend indicators that often help to identify potential network outliers and data issues. \u2022 Overall, the results showed substantial compliance with time and distance standards among core PCPs, facility-based providers, and most specialty care practitioners. Eight CCOs exhibited full compliance with both urban and rural time and distance standards across all provider types. \u2022 Nearly all CCOs demonstrated full compliance with time and distance standards for PCPs. While CPCCO was noncompliant with urban time and distance standards for SUD providers and OB/GYN and OPT specialty providers, at least 90 percent of the CCO\u2019s members had access to a SUD provider. Geographic areas impacting CPCCO\u2019s noncompliance, while classified as urban, were predominantly rural and would have been compliant with rural time and distance standards. As such, overall OHP members had access within time and distance standards to PCPs statewide. Results for key facilities were also high but not at full compliance for four CCOs in rural or frontier settings (i.e., AH, AllCare, CPCCO, and EOCCO). While caution should be used when evaluating the CCOs\u2019 compliance with time and distance standards, the results suggest that the CCOs\u2019 distribution of providers was in alignment with their member population centers, resulting in a high degree of compliance with access standards for key PCPs and facilities. \u2022 Overall, the CCOs demonstrated some improvement in the quality and completeness of provider capacity data reporting, though opportunities for improvement continue to exist. Quantitative assessment of the quality of quarterly provider capacity data showed that the CCOs generally demonstrated greater compliance with the reporting requirements and file integrity with higher levels",

Secret Shopper Survey Survey findings identified several opportunities to improve the quality of the CCOs\u2019 provider capacity data and address the availability of new patient appointments for OHP members. The following are the conclusions from the study: \u2022 In total, 2,322 provider offices (90.2 percent) were unable to be reached, did not offer the requested services, were not at the sampled location, did not accept the requested CCO, did not accept OHP, were not accepting new patients, or were unable to offer an appointment date. \u2022 The overall response rate was 76.5 percent (N=1,969). Of the 604 cases that could not be reached, 39.9 percent (N=241) of the cases were due to bad phone number information (i.e., disconnected number, fax number, or a nonmedical facility). Response rates for PCPs and PCDs were similar at 75.6 percent and 79.8 percent, respectively. \u2013 Individual CCO response rates ranged from 58.9 percent (IHN) to 89.3 percent (JCC). \u2013 IHN had the highest percentage of cases in which the service location was unable to be reached (25.7 percent) or had a bad number (15.4 percent). \u2022 Once contact with a provider office was made, callers verified provider information prior to requesting the availability of appointments. Errors associated with provider data resulted in decreased opportunities to secure an appointment, representing substantial barriers to obtaining an appointment. In general, PCD offices exhibited fewer data quality issues than the PCP offices. Of the cases that were reached: - 10.7 percent of the survey respondents reported that the sampled address was incorrect, and a forwarding number was not available for the requested address. - 45.9 percent of the survey respondents did not offer the requested services. Moreover, 56.2 percent of the PCP locations and 12.5 percent of the PCD locations did not offer the requested services. - 58.4 percent of the survey respondents did not accept OHP. - 69.8 percent of the survey respondents did not accept the requested CCO. - 76.2 percent of the survey respondents reported not accepting new patients at the time of the outreach call. Comments captured from the provider offices included that they were only taking established patients associated with OHP and/or the CCO, not taking new patients due to provider retirement, and not taking new patients at the specific location surveyed. \u2022 Of the survey respondents reached, only 12.7 percent resulted in an appointment date due to the quality of provider data and conditional requirements associated with scheduling appointments. In addition to barriers created through inaccurate provider data, common reasons for not scheduling an appointment included requiring pre-registration, personal information, completion of",

Of the cases reached for which a nonurgent or routine appointment was made, 53.7 percent and 87.6 percent of the appointments were compliant with appointment availability standards (i.e., seven calendar days) for new and established patients, respectively. The results suggest that while established patients are more likely to obtain an appointment within seven calendar days, just over half of new patients failed to get an appointment within seven calendar days. \u2022 The overall average wait times for urgent BH visits was 16 calendar days for new patients and four calendar days for existing patients. Of the cases reached for which an urgent appointment was made, 24.7 percent and 62.0 percent of the appointments were compliant with appointment availability standards (i.e., 24 hours) for new and established patients, respectively. The results suggest that while established patients are more likely to obtain an appointment within 24 hours, nearly one-third do not.

Of the six CCOs performing below the CCO aggregate score, four (YCCO, CHA, IHN, and AllCare) had substantially lower overall scores (i.e., greater than 10 percent difference). \u2022 In general, some CCOs continued to struggle with describing their network monitoring programs, including the collection and use of provider, member, and network adequacy data to drive network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. Individual CCO approaches varied widely in methodology and the frequency at which network performance metrics are monitored and addressed. HSAG noted considerable variation in the technical specifications and protocols used to assess timely access to appointments, monitor member populations with disabilities and special health care needs (SHCN), calculate provider-to-member ratio data, and track telehealth utilization data. \u2022 Several CCOs were not compliant with OHA provider monitoring and reporting standards related to monitoring by individual specialty type. Most CCOs expanded their approach to assessing wait time to appointment availability beyond the monitoring of member grievances, incorporating quarterly or annual provider surveys. While the adoption of more direct and robust monitoring by the CCOs demonstrated ongoing improvement since 2021, only two CCOs conducted secret shopper surveys and only five CCOs proactively surveyed members regarding their appointment availability experiences. \u2022 Prior to 2023, State reporting and monitoring standards and guidance for specialty providers were very limited, combining all such providers into an aggregate \u201cSpecialty\u201d category, making analysis of members\u2019 access less meaningful and noncompliant with the need to monitor and report the necessary range of specialty provider services adequate for the member population (i.e., 42 CFR \u00a7438.207[b]). With most CCOs reporting individual specialty provider types in 2023, the evaluation showed that many CCOs continued to experience gaps in access to care for multiple specialties, particularly for rural settings that had small numbers of contracted providers operating in a CCO\u2019s service area. \u2022 In general, the CCOs demonstrated greater availability and accessibility among its PCPs and PCDs than its MH and SUD providers. However, the results associated with some data elements (e.g., provider capacity) also suggested ongoing data issues with data reporting across several CCOs. Findings also showed potential barriers to provider availability and accessibility for certain specialty provider types (i.e., END, NEPH, PUL, and SLP) within several CCOs and statewide. Two CCOs in particular (i.e., CPCCO and JCC) failed to address persistent issues in their provider availability and accessibility data as identified in prior years\u2019 DSN Evaluations. Additionally, PCP capacity and the percentage of PCPs accepting new patients for some CCOs were inconsistently reported and suggested illogical conclusions\u2014i.e., PCP maximum capacity being much higher than population needs. For example, one CCO\u2019s (CHA\u2019s) data showed that 75 percent of PCPs were accepting new patients, yet PCP capacity was 100 percent (i.e., no members were assigned). Data for MH and SUD providers suggested a statewide language accessibility issue with all but one CCO (CHA) reporting that less than 5 percent of all MH and SUD providers spoke a prevalent non-English language. Secret Shopper Survey \u2022 Overall, HSAG was unable to contact 23.5 percent of the sampled locations, with 9.4 percent of the cases being unable to be reached due to bad phone number information (i.e., disconnected number, fax number, or a nonmedical facility).

For the CCOs statewide, the following recommendations were identified to evaluate and address deficiencies in the statewide DSN reporting activity: Delivery System Network Evaluation \u2022 The CCOs should ensure that all DSN Provider Narrative Template responses provide sufficient information to demonstrate that collected data are used to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making, and should provide sufficient and relevant explanation for planned network interventions. \u2022 The CCOs should ensure that all future reporting utilizes the state-established specialty provider taxonomies current to the review period, and should demonstrate how it collects and uses DSN data to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. \u2022 The CCOs should investigate all potential data issues and potential barriers to care identified and implement mechanisms to improve data quality. If needed, the CCOs should work collaboratively with and seek technical assistance from OHA to determine the nature of the data quality issues to ensure effective corrective action. \u2022 OHA and the CCOs should work collaboratively to develop a standardized methodology for monitoring members\u2019 accessibility and utilization of interpreter services. \u2022 The CCOs should seek technical assistance from OHA regarding the collecting, monitoring, and reporting of network monitoring requirements and how to use the information to support network management, including conducting assessments to understand the member populations and needs.

Based on the initial questionnaire responses, HSAG identified additional follow-up questions specific to each CCO, and the CCOs provided responses to these tailored questions. To support their questionnaire responses, the CCOs submitted a diverse array of documents with varying formats and levels of detail. Encounter Data Process Flow This section of the report summarizes the description of the complete life cycle of dental encounter data processing including the following: extraction from claims adjudication system, preparation of dental encounter files, submission to OHA, reconciliation with OHA, and final storage/management of dental encounter data for internal reporting. The CCOs were asked about the configuration of their data process flow for dental encounters across their entire network. Generally, their processes are similar with slight variations depending on their unique encounter processing systems. With the exception of CHA, all CCOs delegated claims processing and dental provider management to their dental subcontractor(s). The dental encounter data submission process adheres to a complex set of rules designed to determine the readiness of claims for encounter. This readiness is contingent on claims being adjudicated, paid (if necessary), and finalized. Typically, a weekly job is executed to identify claims eligible for encounter, considering both recently adjudicated claims and old, pended claims. Claims pended pre-submission due to specific errors are reevaluated, and if deemed ready, they are resent after allowing time for corrections. File processing involves individual subcontractors\u2019 processing dental claims and creating 837D files, which are either submitted directly to OHA or by the CCO themselves. Files submitted directly to OHA are mostly shared with the CCOs for reporting purposes. CCOs receive the 999 response files from OHA, which are then shared and are addressed by the subcontractors. The subcontractors make necessary corrections and resend the files to OHA. The 835 files that OHA sends to the CCOs undergo reconciliation with 837 files. Any discrepancies are addressed by the encounter team to ensure accurate reporting before subsequent file submissions. The CCOs receive a \u201cPendStatus\u201d file, which is treated similarly to the 835, and distribute claims for each subcontractor, aiding in monitoring pends and facilitating corrections. The 837D reconciliation process involves the Claim Count Verification (CCV) file, a weekly report that OHA sends to the CCOs. This report reconciles submitted encounter data with claims rejected and pended. The entire process encompasses secure file transfer protocol file transfers, responses, and thorough reconciliation efforts to align reported encounter data accurately. This detailed encounter data submission and reconciliation",

Feedback from OHA Upon receiving dental encounters from either the subcontractors or the CCOs, OHA generated a series of response files. The CCOs were asked to provide information regarding the total number of dental encounters submitted, initially rejected, and initially rejected but later resubmitted during the measurement period (i.e., January 1, 2022\u2013December 31, 2022). Table 4-33 displays the percentage of dental encounters that were rejected and not yet accepted by OHA. The column labeled \u201cEDI Rejections\u201d represents the percentage of encounters initially rejected due to OHA electronic data interchange (EDI) translator compliance checks based on established EDI standards and guidelines. The column labeled \u201cOHA Edit Rejections\u201d indicates the percentage of encounters initially rejected due to OHA encounter edits. CCOs had the capability to make corrections to these rejected encounters and subsequently resubmit them to OHA. The \u201cResubmitted and Not Yet Accepted\u201d column illustrates the percentage of total encounters that were initially rejected (either due to OHA\u2019s EDI translator or OHA\u2019s encounter edits) and were later resubmitted but have not yet been accepted.

Weekly status files are loaded to pull all pending claims, which are then analyzed to determine if providers can be contacted for corrected claims or if refunds are necessary. If a corrected claim is obtained, the original claim in production will be corrected and resubmitted with frequency code 7. If a refund is required, the claim will be adjusted, voided, and resubmitted CHA with frequency code 8 using a corrections and reversal adjustment code and reason code 129.

HSAG requested both OHA and the CCOs\u2019 dental subcontractors submit the final status dental claims/encounters in their data submissions for the study. To compare OHA\u2019s and the CCOs\u2019 dental subcontractors\u2019 submitted data, HSAG developed a comparable match key between the two data sources. Data fields used in developing the match key varied by CCO but generally included the Internal Control Number ( ICN ) field and the associated claim line number. HSAG concatenated these field values to create a unique match key, which became the unique identifier for each dental encounter detail line in OHA\u2019s and each CCO\u2019s subcontractors\u2019 data.

    "text": "Encounter record omission and surplus rates are summary metrics designed to evaluate discrepancies between two data sources\u2014i.e., primary and secondary. The primary data source refers to data maintained by an organization (e.g., the CCOs\u2019 source claims data) responsible for sending data to another organization (e.g., OHA). The secondary data source refers to data acquired by the receiving organization. By comparing these two data sources (i.e., primary and secondary), the analysis yields the percentage of records contained in one source and not the other, and vice versa. As such, encounter record omission refers to the percentage of encounters reported in the primary data source but missing from the secondary data source. For this analysis, the omission rate identifies the percentage of encounters reported by a CCO but missing from OHA\u2019s data. Similarly, the encounter record surplus rate refers to the percentage of encounters reported in the secondary data source (OHA) but missing from the primary data source (CCO). Encounter Data Record Omission and Record Surplus Table 4-39 displays the percentage of records present in the files submitted by the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors that were not found in OHA\u2019s files (record omission), and the percentage of records present in OHA\u2019s files but not present in the files submitted by the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors (record surplus).

    "text": "Data Element Completeness HSAG based data element completeness measures on the number of records that match in both the OHA-submitted data files and the CCOs\u2019 subcontractor-submitted data files. HSAG evaluates element- level completeness based on element omission and element surplus rates. The element omission rate represents the percentage of records with values present in the CCOs\u2019 subcontractor-submitted data files but not in the OHA-submitted data files. Similarly, the element surplus rate reports the percentage of records with values present in the OHA-submitted data files but not in the CCOs\u2019 subcontractor- submitted data files. HSAG considers the data elements relatively complete when they have low element omission and surplus rates. Data element accuracy is limited to those records present in both data sources with values present in both data sources. HSAG does not include records in the denominator if values are missing in at least one data source. The numerator is the number of records with the same non-missing values for a given data element. Higher data element accuracy rates indicate that the values populated for a data element in OHA-submitted encounter data are more accurate. Finally, this section presents the all-element accuracy results for records present in both data sources with the same values (missing or non-missing) for all key data elements relevant to dental claim type. The denominator for the all-element accuracy rate is defined differently from the denominator for the element accuracy rate since it includes data elements even if values are missing in both sources. If any of the data elements are in element omission, element surplus, or an inaccurate value match, the record will not be a positive hit for the all-element accuracy numerator.

    "text": "For the CCOs statewide, the following conclusions were made: \u2022 The targeted assessment of encounter data information systems and processes questionnaire responses showed that the CCOs and their subcontractors have the capability to collect, process, and transmit claims and encounter data to OHA that align with encounter data submission requirements. \u2022 Except for CHA, all CCOs delegated claims processing and dental provider management to subcontractors. \u2022 Of the CCOs that used dental subcontractors to collect and process dental encounters, only six CCOs retained responsibility for submitting dental encounters to OHA; seven of the CCOs delegated this responsibility to subcontractors. Three CCOs reported mixed responses with only some subcontractors managing encounter submissions directly to OHA. All CCOs received copies of dental encounters from subcontractors, with nearly all integrating this data for internal purposes. Reviewing encounters before or after OHA submission was a common practice for all CCOs. While most refrained from altering encounters, one CCO (YCCO) acknowledged that it edited subcontractor data before submission. \u2022 Overall, all CCOs and their subcontractors used one or more methods to assess and monitor the quality of dental encounter submissions. The most prevalent quality checks assessed the completeness and accuracy of dental encounters and were reported by all CCOs followed by the monitoring of timeliness (12 CCOs) and claim volume by month (11 CCOs). Notably, only seven CCOs or their subcontractors mentioned assessing alignment of payment fields in claims with financial reports, with others not addressing this aspect in their responses. \u2022 The overall data element omission rates and surplus rates were very low for most of the evaluated data elements. However, TCHP-North exhibited high omission rates for Tooth Number and Tooth Surface 1 , which were attributed to data misalignment from the subcontractor, Capitol Dental. Additionally, there were high surplus rates for Tooth Number for IHN and Rendering Provider NPI for 10 of the CCOs. In the case of IHN, records with Tooth Number surplus were associated with the subcontractor, Advantage Dental, and nearly half of them had the same Billing Provider NPI . For the 10 CCOs with high Rendering Provider NPI element surplus rates, further investigation revealed that more than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data that were not in the CCO-submitted data had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This was likely due to how OHA processes data and handles this data element in the MMIS. \u2022 Overall, among records that could be matched between the OHA-submitted data and the CCO- submitted data, a high level of data element accuracy was observed. However, exceptions were noted, particularly in tooth information for CPCCO and TCHP-North\u2019s data, where some discrepancies in accuracy rates were identified. \u2022 For CPCCO, the discrepancy in tooth surface values resulted from four total tooth surface values being populated in the OHA-submitted data and five populated in the CPCCO-submitted data, causing misalignment during comparison and contributing to a lower accuracy rate for Tooth Surface 4 . Similarly, overall misalignment in the Capitol Dental data submitted by TCHP-North led to lower accuracy rates for CDT Code , Tooth Number, and Tooth Surface 1 through Tooth Surface 4.",

    "text": "\u2022 The overall all-element accuracy rate was high at 97.6 percent. With the exception of IHN and TCHP-North, all CCOs had an all-element accuracy rate greater than or equal to 97.0 percent. In the case of IHN, the high element surplus rate for Tooth Number (13.1 percent) contributed to the lower all-element accuracy rate of 86.3 percent, while for TCHP-North, the previously mentioned misalignment in Capitol Dental\u2019s data resulted in the lower all-element accuracy rate of 70.6 percent. For the CCOs statewide, the following opportunities for improvement were identified: \u2022 During the review of the CCOs\u2019 and their dental subcontractors\u2019 questionnaire responses, HSAG noted five CCOs that did not mention conducting an encounter data quality check on claim volume by submission month. In addition, four CCOs or their subcontractors did not specify timeliness for monitoring dental encounter data. \u2022 The CCOs' subcontractors encountered challenges in extracting and submitting required data elements, revealing potential limitations in knowledge and oversight. The report highlighted issues such as missing data and duplicated records, indicating a need for improved data extraction procedures. These challenges may stem from an inability to accurately query and report data from their encounter data systems. \u2022 Some CCOs had missing values in the MMIS ICN field within their submitted claims data. During its development of the match key for the comparative analysis, HSAG noted instances where ICN values were absent in CCO-submitted data. This absence may have resulted in higher record omission and surplus rates given that HSAG\u2019s match key for the analysis was based on ICN and Line Number. \u2022 While overall results from the comparative analysis indicated a high degree of element completeness and accuracy for key data elements across all CCOs, specific findings associated with tooth information showed high omission rates and/or low accuracy rates. \u2022 Errors in data files extracted for the study were observed in some of the CCOs; consequently, the errors resulted in discrepancies in the comparative analysis. For the CCOs statewide, the following recommendations were identified: \u2022 HSAG recommends the CCOs enhance dental encounter data QA practices by incorporating specific checks, including claim volume by submission month. Additionally, the CCOs should establish clear and documented processes for monitoring the timeliness of data. \u2022 The CCOs should ensure their subcontractors implement and/or augment standard quality controls to ensure accurate report and data extract production. Data quality checks should encompass various aspects, including adherence to data submission requirements, reasonable control totals, assessment of duplicate records, evaluation of data field value distributions, presence checks for missing values, and validation of data field values for reasonability. \u2022 All CCOs should collect and retain ICN values within information systems to enhance data integrity and support monitoring activities. \u2022 HSAG recommends all CCOs to work with OHA to determine the root cause(s) and resolve any identified issue(s) related to tooth information that resulted in high omission rates and/or low accuracy rates.",

    "text": "Treatment Limitation Reviews The following results highlight the types of treatment limitations used by the CCOs to manage the administration of MH/SUD and M/S covered benefits. Four types of treatment limitations were evaluated across IP, OP, Rx, and EC services: \u2022 Financial Requirements\u2014 payments by members for services received that are in addition to payments made by the CCO (e.g., copayments and deductibles ). \u2022 Aggregate Lifetime or Annual Dollar Limits\u2014 dollar limits on the total amount of a specified benefit over a lifetime or on an annual basis. \u2022 Quantitative Treatment Limitations\u2014 limits 4-8 on the scope or duration of a benefit that are expressed numerically (e.g., days or visit limits). \u2022 Non-Quantitative Treatment Limitations\u2014 limits on the scope or duration of benefits, such as PA or network admission standards. NQTLs were separated into three main categories\u2014i.e., Medical Management, Provider Network, and Pharmacy Management. Responses to the MHP Treatment Limitation Review Tool , along with supplemental documentation (e.g., policies, procedures, processes, and workflows), were used to assess the extent to which treatment limitations were implemented and whether documentation demonstrated compliance with how MH parity requirements for MH/SUD and M/S services and benefits. To assess compliance, CCO documentation was reviewed to determine: \u2022 The rationale for implementing the treatment limitation. \u2022 The process and strategy for applying the treatment limitation. \u2022 The evidentiary standards used to define the treatment limitation and assess medical necessity. \u2022 The frequency and stringency with which the treatment limitation was applied. Information collected was then used to determine whether processes were standardized, implemented, and applied with comparable frequency and rigor across MH/SUD and M/S benefits. Financial Requirements None of the CCOs reported the use of FRs in the administration of MH/SUD or M/S benefits across IP, OP, Rx, or EC services.",

Quantitative Treatment Limitations Although most CCOs reported that their organizations did not apply QTLs in the administration of MH/SUD and M/S benefits across IP, OP, Rx, or EC services, seven CCOs reported using QTLs in the management of MH/SUD or M/S benefits. Specifically: \u2022 EOCCO, IHN, PCS-CG, PCS-CO, PCS-Lane, and PCS-MP noted implementation of quantity limits on the day\u2019s supply for MH/SUD and M/S prescriptions. \u2022 UHA noted implementation of limits on the number of hours and/or visits associated with select MH/SUD services (e.g., withdrawal management, residential treatment, and testing) and M/S services (e.g., acupuncture, home health services, and occupational/physical therapy). However, upon review, the QTLs were identified as soft limits and incorrectly categorized since the seven CCOs allowed members to receive additional services based on an evaluation of medical necessity through PA or concurrent review (CR). As such, none of the CCOs reported the use of QTLs in the administration of MH/SUD or M/S benefits across IP, OP, Rx, or EC services.

To facilitate the presentation of results, the differences noted between MH/SUD and M/S performance metrics are displayed as an absolute value, or difference. 4-10 As such, the larger the number in the figure, the greater the difference between the MH/SUD and M/S performance metrics. Claims To conduct the claims analysis, the CCOs submitted claims counts that encompassed all covered services (except NEMT and Rx 4-11 ) by claim type (i.e., IP and OP) and provider network status (i.e., in- network and out-of-network at the header and detail claim level. Since claims are paid at the detail (service) line level, aggregate header counts were categorized as paid, partially paid, and denied. Claims were defined as partially paid if at least one detail claim line was denied; claims that included all paid detail lines or all denied detail lines should be classified as paid claims and denied claims, respectively. The total number of IP and OP claims was evaluated at the header level and reported as the total number paid (i.e., paid and partially paid claims) and denied overall, and by network status. The aggregate counts from the CCOs were then used to generate the percentage of claims paid by benefit type; the difference between the percentage of paid claims for MH/SUD versus M/S services was then evaluated as the core metric for evaluating parity. The absolute difference was used to classify the deviation in the rates of claims paid between MH/SUD and M/S services to determine if the difference was negligible (less than 5 percentage points), moderate (greater than or equal to 5 percentage points, but less than 10 percentage points), or substantial (greater than or equal to 10 percentage points). Although data were not available to determine the types of services that were paid versus denied, moderate and substantial differences in rates identify areas where operational policies and procedures (i.e., claims submission requirements, authorization determinations, claims processing, provider billing, etc.) highlight instances where MH/SUD and M/S outcomes were different and warrant further review, especially when the differences were outliers compared to other CCOs and the CCO aggregate.

The file review included: \u2022 Assessing compliance with federal and State regulations governing the processing of member NOABDs for service authorization denials and NOARs, including timeliness and accessibility. \u2022 Assessing the timeliness of service authorization denials and member appeal decisions. In alignment with prior findings, the file reviews continued to demonstrate generalized issues with the CCOs\u2019 compliance with federal and State regulatory requirements surrounding the processing of NOABDs and NOARs. However, these issues were related to general implementation of the CCOs\u2019 procedures and did not reveal substantial differences in the application to MH/SUD and M/S services. Overall, the file reviews showed the CCOs had consistent issues meeting readability and accessibility standards (i.e., materials are to be written at a sixth-grade reading level) for both denial and appeal written notices, while CCOs were generally compliant with denial and appeal time frames. Provider Enrollment In order to assess parity related to management of provider networks, the CCOs submitted the average monthly count of MH/SUD and M/S providers along with the total number of provider applications processed, approved, and denied as well as terminated (including not being recredentialed) in CY 2022. All counts were stratified by benefit type to facilitate comparisons. These data points were collected to offer information on parity of provider credentialing practices between MH/SUD and M/S. The aggregate counts from the CCOs were then used to generate the percentage of providers terminated and approved by benefit type; the difference between the percentage of providers terminated and approved MH/SUD and M/S providers was then evaluated as the core metric for evaluating parity. The absolute difference was used to classify the deviation in termination and approval rates between MH/SUD and M/S providers to determine if the difference was negligible (less than 5 percentage points), moderate (greater than or equal to 5 percentage points, but less than 10 percentage points), or substantial (greater than or equal to 10 percentage points). In addition to assessing the absolute difference in the percentage of terminated and approved providers, the analysis indicated whether the difference identified greater rates of termination/approval for MH/SUD providers versus M/S providers. The following figures display the results of the comparisons in the percentage of terminated and approved applications for MH/SUD and M/S providers for all CCOs, where available.",

These standards included the average travel time (in minutes) and driving distance (in miles) to the nearest provider for each type of provider. Additionally, the analysis included the travel time and distance to the subsequent second and third nearest provider to further assess the overall availability of MH and SUD providers. Table 4-50 presents the average time and distance to the nearest three MH providers, by CCO and geographic setting (i.e., urban or rural). If the average driving time or distance exceeded the time and distance requirements set forth by OHA, the result is shaded in red.

Although the evaluation identified several opportunities for improvement, results did not identify systemic issues that negatively impacted parity between MH/SUD and M/S services. Rather, findings frequently highlighted general regulatory compliance issues affecting both MH/SUD and M/S benefits uniformly. \u2022 Of the four treatment limitations, the CCOs used a variety of NQTLs (i.e., Medical Management, Provider Network, and Pharmacy Management) to manage and ensure members\u2019 health care services received were necessary and appropriate. Among the most prevalent were UM processes (i.e., PA, CR, and retrospective review, medical necessity criteria, provider credentialing requirements, and drug utilization review mechanisms (i.e., formulary design). Overall, the CCOs demonstrated a high level of compliance with parity requirements for individual NQTLs when sufficient information and supporting documentation were provided for the implemented NQTL. Seven CCOs demonstrated full compliance across all NQTL domains while nine CCOs received an overall parity rating of Partially Compliant due to one or more domains being Partially Compliant\u2014 most frequently NQTLs associated with Pharmacy Management. \u2022 Overall, the CCOs demonstrated that medical necessity criteria information was made available to members, potential members, and network providers through a variety of formats, including member handbooks, provider manuals, CCO websites, and via notices to members when a service or reimbursement for an MH/SUD service was denied. Two CCOs (i.e., AH and AllCare) received Partially Compliant parity ratings due to insufficient documentation demonstrating how medical necessity criteria were disseminated to all required individuals or evidence that these criteria were shared. \u2022 For the Administrative Data Profile, parity between MH/SUD and M/S benefit administration was evaluated across three domains: claims (i.e., paid IP and OP claims, including in- and out-of-network providers); UM (i.e., IP, OP, and Rx PA denials); and provider enrollment (i.e., terminations and provider application approvals). Overall, CCO aggregate results across each domain continued to show minimal differences in the administration of MH/SUD and M/S benefits across the CCOs, although considerable variation in CCO performance remains within each of the measures.",

When individual CCO differences were moderate or substantial for paid IP and OP claims, the deviation was generally due to a higher percentage of paid MH/SUD claims versus paid M/S claims. \u2022 Overall, differences in the percentage of denials for MH/SUD and M/S PA requests continued to vary across all service types (i.e., IP, OP, and Rx). While the percentage point differences in the CCO aggregate denial rates were negligible between IP and Rx MH/SUD and M/S services, the percentage point difference in the CCO aggregate OP denial rate was substantial (greater than 10 percentage points). \u2022 Overall, the difference in the statewide CCO percentage of terminated providers for MH/SUD and M/S providers was negligible, with 14 CCOs exhibiting little to no difference in the percentage of MH/SUD and M/S providers terminated or not recredentialed in CY 2022, While the remaining CCOs showed substantial differences in the percentage of terminated providers, those differences were related to higher termination rates among M/S providers. Similarly, the difference in the statewide CCO percentage of provider applications approved for MH/SUD and M/S providers was also negligible, with all but two CCOs exhibiting little to no difference in the percentage of MH/SUD and M/S provider applications approved in CY 2022. \u2022 Between 2022 and 2023, CCOs exhibited substantial increases in the number of contracted MH and SUD provider counts across all CCOs, with only a few demonstrating decreases in the count of MH and SUD providers. Several factors likely contributed to these increases, including the CCOs\u2019 efforts to increase enrollment and contracting with MH providers in response to members\u2019 needs as well as improvements to the quality of provider data and changes in study protocols (e.g., provider categorization). Additionally, provider-to-member ratios were low, indicating the CCOs had a large number of providers contracted to perform MH and SUD services relative to members with an MH or SUD diagnosis. \u2022 The CY 2023 MHP Evaluation assessed the geographic distribution of MH and SUD providers relative to members with an MH or SUD diagnosis. In general, the results demonstrated that the average drive time and distance to the nearest three MH and SUD providers were within time and distance requirements set by OHA for both urban and rural geographic settings (i.e., 30 minutes/30 miles for urban areas and 60 minutes/60 miles for rural areas). Moreover, with one exception, the CCOs were in compliance with OHA time and distance standards, demonstrating that 95 percent of members with an MH or SUD diagnosis had access to MH and SUD services. However, while these results suggest that MH and SUD providers were distributed in proportion to members\u2019 locations, the findings should be interpreted with caution, as the specific types of MH and SUD providers within time and distance parameters may or may not be relevant to specific member needs. Additionally, time and distance metrics represent only one of several network monitoring metrics used to assess provider network adequacy. \u2022 Overall, only 2.2 percent of all CCO grievances were associated with MH/SUD benefits or service, with an average CCO rate of 3.1 percent. The results showed a consistent distribution of MH/SUD- related grievances, with most CCOs having less than 6 percent of all grievances related to MH/SUD services (excluding AllCare at 38.0 percent).

    "text": "grievances associated with MH/SUD services was low for CCOs, with an aggregate rate of 17.0 percent, the range of access-related MH/SUD grievances across individual CCOs was substantially wider. It is important to note that grievances are a limited monitoring tool for CCOs, given that members must have both the means and the inclination to file a grievance. These results reinforce OHA\u2019s guidance that grievance monitoring, while required and valuable, likely captures only a fraction of members\u2019 overall experiences and should not be used as the total or primary mechanism for monitoring network adequacy and decision making. Further, due to the nature of MH/SUD clinical conditions, members with MH/SUD diagnoses may be less likely to file a grievance with the health plan than those with a M/S diagnosis, contributing to the low rate of grievances and thereby underestimating these results. For the CCOs statewide, the following opportunities for improvement were identified: \u2022 Overall, the CCOs reported that their organizations did not apply FRs or AL/ADLs in the administration of MH/SUD and M/S benefits for IP, OP, Rx, or EC services. Additionally, while some CCOs reported using QTLs in the management of MH/SUD and M/S benefits, the QTLs were identified as soft limits and incorrectly categorized by the CCOs. This finding suggests confusion among CCO staff regarding the nature of benefit limitations and how they apply to understanding parity across MH/SUD and M/S benefits. These findings align with prior MHP evaluations and the regulatory structure of the Oregon managed care program. \u2022 The majority of the Partially Compliant and Not Compliant findings resulted from insufficient information or clear evidence of parity associated with selection of the NQTL and the consistency and stringency with which it was applied to MH/SUD and M/S benefits across service types (i.e., IP, OP, and Rx). Only two CCOs were Partially Compliant across all reported domains, due to the lack of information regarding delegated subcontractors\u2019 policies and procedures, or challenges addressing MHP requirements. \u2022 The review of availability of information identified that several organizations included links to the Health Evidence Review Commission Prioritized List of Health Services without interpretive guidelines or instructions, which could represent a barrier to members\u2019 understanding of these resources. \u2022 The review of administrative data from the CCOs raised concerns related to the quality and consistency of data and/or implementation of claims, UM, and provider enrollment processes, although this is not necessarily indicative of an impact on parity across benefit types. Identified differences in claims, UM, and provider enrollment outcome patterns suggest additional review by the CCOs is needed. \u2022 When CCO absolute differences in the percentage of PA denials were moderate or substantial , MH/SUD PA requests were typically denied less frequently than M/S PA requests. A review of denial reasons across benefit type and services revealed that most denials were related to services not meeting clinical criteria or for non-covered services. However, while patterns of denial reasons were relatively stable, OP PA denials demonstrated variations in between MH/SUD and M/S services with a greater percentage of MH/SUD OP PA denials related to UM controls and treatment limitations, administrative denials, and out-of-network providers suggesting an area requiring greater review to ensure parity across MH/SUD and M/S services.",

Although differences in the percentage of paid out-of-network claims may be legitimate, they may also indicate procedural or network differences that highlight potential barriers to members' access to MH/SUD services. \u2022 Overall, nearly all CCOs reported assessing appointment availability as part of their ongoing monitoring of network adequacy using provider surveys. In some cases, CCOs conducted secret shopper surveys of providers or surveyed members about their experience with appointment availability. However, the CCOs described a variety of approaches to collecting and using these data, with widely varying degrees of relevance, rigor, and utility. As a result, data are not comparable across plans and, in some cases, are of limited value to support network adequacy monitoring for CCOs. Importantly, these provider surveys frequently stratified results by provider type and included assessments of appointment availability to MH/SUD providers. For the CCOs statewide, the following recommendations were identified: \u2022 Based on the findings in this report, HSAG recommends that, in addition to completing planned attestations in 2024 and 2025, CCOs receiving a treatment limitation rating of Partially Met or Not Met for medical management, provider network, or pharmacy management controls should be required to resubmit responses and documentation to demonstrate compliance with parity requirements until all outstanding items are resolved. \u2022 The CCOs should review out-of-network claim denials to understand factors affecting the lower percentage of paid MH/SUD IP and OP claims compared to M/S IP and OP claims, and assess whether any barriers exist for members accessing MH/SUD services, including the need to seek services outside the CCO's network (e.g., appointment availability). \u2022 The CCOs should take steps to ensure that available information is readily accessible to members.",

Why the weakness exists: AH \u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Additionally, AH failed to notify lower acuity members of the person formally designated as primarily responsible for coordinating the services accessed by the member. Finally, AH failed to demonstrate a streamlined method of assessing and reassessing members and updating the member\u2019s care plan within the appropriate time frame for members enrolled in case management. Recommendations: AH must revise its policies and procedures to align with federal and State requirements. AH must also demonstrate notification to members at all levels of the person formally designated as primarily responsible for coordinating the services accessed by the member. Finally, AH must demonstrate implementation of appropriate assessments, reassessments, and revision of treatment plans according to federal and State requirements. Weakness: AH received a score of 63.9 percent in Standard IV\u2014 Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting AH\u2019s ability to adhere to federal and State requirements for authorizing services and to ensure proper and timely notification of adverse benefit determinations. Why the weakness exists: AH\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Additionally, AH demonstrated reversing service authorization decisions outside the appeal process. AH also failed to demonstrate mechanisms for ensuring consistent application of medical necessity criteria. Finally, AH failed to adhere to requirements for the appropriate decision-makers, proper outreach to retrieve the information needed to process service authorization requests, time frames and required content for NOABDs, and adherence to federal and State extension requirements. Recommendations: AH must revise its policies and procedures to align with federal and State requirements.

Weakness: AH received a score of 70.8 percent in Standard XVI\u2014 Emergency and Poststabilization Services due to a lack of operational structure to ensure poststabilization services are covered appropriately. Why the weakness exists: AH failed to demonstrate plan documents, such as policies and procedures, and the provider manual did not appropriately define \u201cemergency and poststabilization services\u201d and communicate the appropriate requirements.

In addition, the CCO\u2019s MY 2022 rates in both age groups exceeded the 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more.

Weakness: AH\u2019s MY 2022 rates on the Initiation of SUD Treatment and Engagement of SUD Treatment measure indicators for members ages 18 years and older fell below the statewide aggregate and the 2020 HEDIS national Medicaid median benchmarks set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more. Why the weakness exists: In response to EQR recommendations, AH noted that access to reliable, real-time, and actionable data on the utilization of SUD treatment services continues to be a consistent barrier to performance on the Initiation and Engagement of SUD Treatment measure. Recommendations: AH took several steps in 2022 to improve performance on this measure. AH used internal claims-based dashboards to visualize utilization of SUD treatment services and identify gaps in the provider network. Additionally, AH participated in the statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP introduced by OHA in 2022 and supported peer support specialists with the work of reaching members in rural and remote communities who are ready to receive SUD treatment. AH should continue implementing these efforts to raise its rates on this measure to the level of the benchmarks set by OHA. Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: AH showed general stability in its provider network and timely access to key primary care service and specialty providers. AH also showed substantial increases in provider types lacking in previous years through additional contracting (i.e., MH and SUD providers).

Although 92.3 percent of the total cases confirmed the location, the rate for PCD cases was 88.9 percent. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of AH\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that AH use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper responsive cases, only 11.5 percent resulted an appointment, and none of the appointments offered by PCD and PCP offices were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of AH\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate.

Weakness: Of the revealed telephone survey sampled cases, only 15.6 percent of the survey respondents offered a new patient appointment, while only 20.0 percent of survey respondents offered an appointment for an existing patient. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 68.8 percent of routine appointments and 46.7 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of AH\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that AH confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. AH should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: The AH - submitted data exhibited high record-level data completeness, with low record omission and surplus rates. Strength: Encounters that could be matched between data extracted from OHA\u2019s data warehouse and data extracted from AH\u2019s or the subcontractor\u2019s data system exhibited a high level of element completeness (i.e., low element omission and surplus rates) across all evaluated key data elements.",

Strength: The AH - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non- missing) in both data sources (AH and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Mental Health Parity Evaluation Weakness: AH was partially compliant with the Medical Management NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: AH did not demonstrate that the processes and requirements used to apply concurrent and retrospective review NQTLs by benefit and service classification to MH/SUD benefits are applied with no more stringency than M/S benefits in the same classification. Recommendations: AH should review its implementation of concurrent and retrospective review NQTLs for OP MH/SUD services to ensure that the additional limitation based on the benefit does not impede the member\u2019s ability to access OP care more so than M/S. Weakness: AH was partially compliant with the Pharmacy Management\u2014Formulary Design NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: AH did not provide its rationale for the assignment of the NQTL (i.e., prescription drug formulary); procedures used for the development formulary (e.g., individuals involved in formulary development, professional guidelines used, and how often the formulary is reviewed and updated/by whom); or how frequently or strictly the NQTL is applied (e.g., ability of the provider to request an exception). Recommendations: AH should identify processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors used in formulary design and application for prescription drugs.",

Why the weakness exists: AllCare\u2019s rate on this measure did not change from MY 2021, and OHA\u2019s 2022 CCO Performance Metrics Annual Report showed statewide performance for the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator declined slightly (0.6 percent) from MY 2021. Recommendations: AllCare should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance. Once identified, targeted interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to ensure effective improvement strategies are adopted to increase performance over time. Additionally, AllCare should continue to monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches to ensuring the quality, timeliness, and accessibility of health care services (e.g., telehealth strategies, mobile clinics). Weakness: AllCare\u2019s MY 2022 rates on the Initiation of SUD Treatment and Engagement of SUD Treatment measure indicators for members ages 18 years and older fell below the statewide aggregate and the 2020 HEDIS national Medicaid median benchmarks set by OHA for MY 2022. Why the weakness exists: In response to EQR recommendations, AllCare discussed efforts undertaken to address existing gaps in the quality, timeliness, and accessibility of SUD treatment services. These gaps include: (1) the need for real-time hospital event notification to ensure members diagnosed with SUD are contacted by BH providers while in the hospital; and (2) the need for increased outreach to members diagnosed with SUD that have housing challenges and/or have not yet received BH services. Recommendations: AllCare took several steps in 2022 to improve performance on this measure. AllCare\u2019s BH Clinical Transitions team sent real-time hospital event notifications to contract BH providers to encourage outreach to members in the hospital. AllCare established working agreements with community-based organizations to leverage their peer specialists for outreach to members who are homeless or have housing challenges. Lastly, AllCare reimbursed BH providers for outreach to members in the pre-engagement or pre-contemplation stages of SUD treatment, as allowed by OHA. AllCare should continue",

Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: AllCare generally improved the overall completeness and accuracy of its provider data reporting compared to previous years. The CCO\u2019s responses within the DSN Provider Narrative Template indicated that this was due to enhanced communication and collaboration with its information technology department. Weakness: AllCare\u2019s DSN Provider Narrative compliance scores overall (63.5 percent), and for the DSN Governance Structure (75.0 percent), Member Needs and Population Management (56.3 percent), and DSN Monitoring and Analysis (50.0 percent) domains were less than 90 percent and the statewide CCO aggregate rates. This deficiency was also found in the CY 2020, CY 2021, and CY 2022 EQRs. Why the weakness exists: AllCare submitted multiple incomplete, insufficient, or irrelevant DSN Provider Narrative Template responses and/or supporting documentation, resulting in a low-quality overall submission. Recommendations: AllCare should ensure that all DSN Provider Narrative Template responses are directly relevant to the element being answered and provide sufficient information to demonstrate that collected data are used to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. Weakness: AllCare\u2019s provider network showed multiple potential barriers to access to care for primary care service and specialty providers, particularly for rural settings in Curry County, urban settings in Josephine County, and members seeking care with a new provider. Why the weakness exists: AllCare did not meet time and distance access standards for multiple specialty providers, with affected communities consistently located in the rural settings of Curry County and urban settings of Josephine County. AllCare\u2019s provider network, including PCPs, showed an overall low percentage of providers accepting new patients. Recommendations: AllCare should ensure it is collecting and reporting provider data accurately, and provide an explanation addressing both noncompliance with State time and distance standards as well as the low rates of providers accepting new patients.",

Although 93.2 percent of the total responsive cases confirmed the location, the rate for PCDs was 84.6 percent. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of AllCare\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that AllCare use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper responsive cases, only 13.5 percent resulted in an appointment. Of the cases that offered an appointment, 50 percent were within the wait time compliance standard.

This oversight contributed to a substantial number of duplicate records, causing a high omission rate. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that AllCare and Capitol Dental/Ayin consider implementing measures to ensure proper handling of data during system migrations. This could involve refining data extraction protocols and conducting thorough data validation checks post-migration to mitigate the risk of high omission rates. Additionally, establishing a comprehensive communication plan between AllCare and its subcontractor, Capitol Dental/Ayin, during such changes could help in preventing oversights and ensuring data accuracy. Mental Health Parity Evaluation Weakness: AllCare\u2019s responses in the MHP Treatment Limitation Review Tool and supplemental documentation were insufficient to demonstrate compliance with parity requirements. Why the weakness exists: AllCare responses and supplemental documentation were limited to changes to treatment limitations implemented during CY 2022 rather than comprehensive responses addressing all treatment limitations applied by the CCO to manage MH/SUD and M/S benefits as directed by the CY 2023 MHP Protocol. Recommendations: AllCare should ensure that submitted descriptions and supplemental documentation are inclusive of all treatment limitations used by the CCO to manage MH/SUD benefits and to demonstrate parity with the treatment limitations applied to M/S benefits. Responses should address the writing prompt questions in the tool related to the CCO\u2019s rationale for the NQTL; the procedures/processes/requirements used to apply the NQTL; the frequency and strictness of the NQTL; and the evidentiary standards to support the rationale for how frequently and strictly the NQTL is applied. In addition, AllCare should ensure that individuals completing the MHP Treatment Limitation Review Tool attend the MHP technical assistance webinar and that they request additional assistance, as needed, to ensure their understanding of the requirements. Weakness: AllCare was partially compliant with the Pharmacy Management\u2014Methods for Determining Reasonable Charges, Formulary Design, and Tier Placement NQTL requirements.

Weakness: AllCare showed a substantial difference in the percentage of paid, out-of-network MH/SUD IP claims compared to M/S IP claims. Although the difference in the percentage of paid claims may be legitimate, it may also highlight procedural or network differences indicating potential barriers for members accessing MH/SUD services. Why the weakness exists: Out-of-network IP MH/SUD claims were paid less frequently than M/S claims. Recommendations: AllCare should review out-of-network claim denials to understand factors affecting the lower percentage of paid MH/SUD IP claims compared to M/S IP claims. AllCare should assess whether any barriers exist for members accessing MH/SUD services, including the need to seek services outside of the CCO\u2019s network (e.g., appointment availability).",

Performance Improvement Projects Statewide Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP Weakness: CHA\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate any improvement over baseline performance. Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: CHA should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. CHA should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Weakness: CHA\u2019s PIP documentation did not demonstrate significant clinical or programmatic improvement in processes and outcomes. Why the weakness exists: CHA did not complete the Clinical and Programmatic Improvement Table; therefore, no evidence was provided to demonstrate significant clinical or programmatic improvement.

Strength: CHA\u2019s performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020. Weakness: CHA\u2019s performance on the Child and Adolescent Well- Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator demonstrated declining performance on this measure since MY 2020. In addition, the CCO\u2019s MY 2022 rate for this measure fell below the statewide aggregate and the 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more. Why the weakness exists: Although CHA\u2019s eligible population for this measure increased from MY 2021 to MY 2022, nearly the same number of children ages 3 to 6 years had a comprehensive well-care visit with their PCP in both MY 2021 and MY 2022. OHA\u2019s 2022 CCO Performance Metrics Annual Report showed statewide performance for the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator declined slightly (0.6 percent) from MY 2021. Recommendations: CHA should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted. Additionally, CHA should monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches for ensuring the timeliness and accessibility of health care services (e.g., telehealth strategies, mobile clinics). Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: CHA generally improved the overall completeness and accuracy of its provider data reporting compared to previous years. Weakness: CHA\u2019s DSN Provider Narrative compliance scores overall (63.5 percent), and for the Member Needs and Population Management (81.3 percent), DSN Monitoring and Analysis (70.0 percent), and Network Response Strategy (58.3 percent) domains were less than 90 percent and the statewide CCO aggregate rates. Why the weakness exists: CHA was not able to describe or demonstrate compliance with several key DSN monitoring and analysis requirements, use collected data to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making for certain services and populations, or provide sufficient explanation for planned network interventions. Recommendations: CHA should ensure that all DSN Provider Narrative Template responses provide sufficient information to demonstrate that collected data are used to inform network adequacy",

Weakness: CHA\u2019s provider data indicated that several potential barriers to care existed, including low percentages of PCPs and PCDs accepting new patients and a lack of several specialty providers (i.e., NEPH and OT). Why the weakness exists: Less than 80 percent of CHA\u2019s PCPs and PCDs were accepting new patients, and the CCO lacked any NEPH and OT specialty providers within its network. CHA did not address these potential barriers to care within its DSN Provider Narrative Template. Recommendations: CHA should investigate the nature of its low new patient acceptance among PCPs and PCDs as well as the lack of NEPH and OT specialty providers, and plan/enact interventions to address these potential barriers as appropriate. Secret Shopper Survey Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 66.7 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the responsive cases, 59.1 percent accepted OHP and CHA, and 45.5 percent accepted new patients. Further, while 100 percent of PCD cases confirmed the location and offered the requested services, only 71.4 percent of PCP cases confirmed the location, and 42.9 percent offered the requested services. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of CHA\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that CHA use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 27.3 percent resulted in an appointment. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of CHA\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that CHA confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients.

Strength: The CHA - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (CHA and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: CHA deviated from the specified data layout in its submission by stacking the header data and the claim line detail data, instead of merging them by ICN , as per the request. Why the weakness exists: Not submitting the data in the requested layout caused discrepancies in the original control total count and analyses. The submitted data format posed challenges for HSAG in obtaining accurate results, necessitating data manipulation, approved by CHA, to align it with the correct format. Recommendations: HSAG recommends CHA align its data submission practices, adhering closely to the specified layout, ensuring a more seamless integration into the analytical process. This adjustment will facilitate accurate and efficient data handling during subsequent phases of analysis and evaluation. Mental Health Parity Evaluation Weakness: CHA showed a substantial difference in the percentage of paid, out-of-network MH/SUD IP claims compared to M/S IP claims. Although differences in the percentage of paid claims may be legitimate, they may also highlight procedural or network differences, indicating potential barriers for members accessing MH/SUD services. Why the weakness exists: Out-of-network IP MH/SUD claims were paid less frequently than M/S claims. Recommendations: CHA should review out-of-network claim denials to understand factors affecting the lower percentage of paid MH/SUD IP claims compared to M/S IP claims. CHA should assess whether any barriers exist for members accessing MH/SUD services, including the need to seek services outside the CCO\u2019s network (e.g., appointment availability).",

Why the weakness exists: CPCCO\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Recommendations: CPCCO must revise its policies and procedures to align with federal and State requirements. Weakness: CPCCO received a score of 69.4 percent in Standard IV\u2014 Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting CPCCO\u2019s ability to adhere to federal and State requirements for authorizing services and to ensure proper and timely notification of adverse benefit determinations. Why the weakness exists: CPCCO\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Additionally, CPCCO demonstrated reversing service authorization decisions outside the appeal process. CPCCO also failed to demonstrate mechanisms for ensuring its UM activities are not structured to incentivize the individual to deny, limit, or discontinue medically necessary services, and consistent application of medical necessity criteria. Finally, CPCCO failed to adhere to requirements for appropriate decision- makers, and provision and required content of NOABDs. Recommendations: CPCCO must revise its policies and procedures to align with federal and State requirements. CPCCO must demonstrate adherence to federal and State requirements for authorization of services, and required content and time frames for notification of adverse benefit determinations. Weakness: CPCCO received a score of 50.0 percent in Standard VII\u2014 Member Rights and Protections due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate implementation of an established process, impacting CPCCO\u2019s ability to ensure that member rights are respected and allowed to be exercised freely without affecting the treatment of members, advance directive requirements are met, and members are notified of their rights as required by federal and State requirements.",

Weakness: CPCCO\u2019s indicator results did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement over baseline performance. Why the weakness exists: The improvement in indicator results from baseline to RY 1 was not statistically significant. Recommendations: CPCCO should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. CPCCO should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to further improve indicator results. Weakness: CPCCO did not demonstrate significant clinical or programmatic improvement in processes and outcomes.

In addition, CPCCO\u2019s performance on the Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services\u2014Ages 1 to 5 Years and Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicators demonstrated ongoing improvement for members in both age groups since MY 2020. Strength: CPCCO\u2019S performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020.

Why the weakness exists: In response to EQR recommendations, CPCCO noted several barriers to implementing performance improvement initiatives, including staffing shortages in its provider network and systemic barriers limiting access to care. Recommendations: In 2022, CPCCO monitored data on performance measures and conducted weekly internal meetings and monthly meetings with network providers to identify and address factors impacting performance. Additionally, CPCCO convened a monthly SUD expert group consisting of leaders from community mental health programs, public health, regional SUD programs, and Columbia Pacific to discuss best practices and address system barriers. CPCCO should continue implementing these efforts to raise its rates on this measure to the level of the benchmarks set by OHA.

Recommendations: CPCCO should ensure that all future reporting utilizes the state-established specialty provider taxonomies current to the review period, and should demonstrate how it collects and uses DSN data to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision- making. Weakness: CPCCO showed potential issues within its provider data, including but not limited to service area activity and status of accepting new patients. This issue was also identified during the CY 2021 and CY 2022 DSN Evaluations and was not addressed by CPCCO. Why the weakness exists: The percentage of providers operating within the service area was approximately 10 percent or less for most providers including PCPs. With the exception of PCPs, less than 1 percent of all provider types were accepting new patients. Recommendations: CPCCO should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them. Secret Shopper Survey Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 71.9 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the total responsive cases, only 89.9 percent of the offices offered the requested services, 73.6 percent accepted OHP, 40.3 percent accepted CPCCO, and 28.7 percent accepted new patients. Although 95.3 percent of the total cases confirmed the location, the rate for PCD cases was 87.0 percent. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of CPCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that CPCCO use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 23.3 percent resulted in an appointment, and only 73.3 percent of those appointments offered were within the wait time compliance standard.

Additionally, internal office procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that CPCCO confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. CPCCO should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls. Revealed Telephone Survey Weakness: Overall, 67.7 percent of the revealed telephone survey total sampled cases were reached, of which three, or 2.4 percent, refused to participate in the survey. Of the total responsive cases, 64.3 percent of the offices offered the requested specialty, 61.9 percent accepted OHP, 37.3 percent accepted CPCCO, and 27.8 percent accepted new patients. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of CPCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that CPCCO use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, program information, and translation/interpreter services offered). Weakness: Of the sampled cases, only 9.1 percent of the revealed telephone survey respondents offered a new patient appointment, while only 11.8 percent of survey respondents offered an appointment for an existing patient. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 38.5 percent of routine appointments and 34.4 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of CPCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that CPCCO confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. CPCCO should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability.",

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-8 Weakness Encounter Data Validation Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited for nearly all evaluated key data elements. Strength: The CPCCO - submitted data had high all-element accuracy, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (CPCCO and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: There were a high number and percentage of records present in the files submitted by OHA but not found in the files submitted by CPCCO\u2019s subcontractor(s) (i.e., record surplus). Why the weakness exists: Based on the data discrepancy report response from CPCCO, the surplus records were primarily associated with its subcontractor, WDG. A high number of WDG records were excluded from analysis due to missing the required variable, Adjudication Date . Recommendations: HSAG recommends that CPCCO proactively inform HSAG about special scenarios like the one observed with WDG, where the Adjudication Date was not populated due to WDG\u2019s capitated nature, that it does not receive, process, or adjudicate claims. Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the CPCCO-submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the CPCCO-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the CPCCO-submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that CPCCO and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence. This adjustment will enhance the accuracy and completeness of the comparative analysis data. Additionally, it will provide HSAG with the",

EOCCO\u2019s performance on the Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services\u2014Ages 1 to 5 Years and Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicators demonstrated ongoing improvement for members in both age groups since MY 2020.

Why the weakness exists: In response to EQR recommendations, EOCCO noted ongoing challenges with the availability of SUD treatment providers in rural and frontier service areas. Recommendations: EOCCO took several steps in 2022 to improve performance on this measure. EOCCO administered a Youth SUD Services Survey to understand available treatment options with CMHPs. EOCCO identified members with a qualifying SUD episode and worked with CMHPs and integrated clinics to engage these members in ongoing treatment services. Lastly, EOCCO monitored out- of-network claims for SUD treatment services and worked to establish contracts with providers to address members\u2019 SUD treatment needs. EOCCO should continue implementing these efforts to raise its rate on this measure indicator to the level of the benchmarks set by OHA.",

Weakness: EOCCO scored below 90 percent and below the CCO aggregate score in two DSN Provider Narrative domains. Why the weakness exists: EOCCO did not demonstrate how it uses collected information on members with physical and mental disabilities, SHCN, and the availability of physical accessibility accommodations to inform its network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. EOCCO did not provide a complete plan for assessing the efficacy of planned interventions, nor did it address all findings identified in the CY 2022 DSN Evaluation. Recommendations: EOCCO should ensure that it describes or demonstrates how collected information is used to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. EOCCO should ensure that all network adequacy interventions include plans for assessing their efficacy. EOCCO should address all findings from prior DSN Evaluations. Weakness: EOCCO\u2019s provider data results suggested potential data issues regarding adult and pediatric populations served, service area, and accepting new patients status. Why the weakness exists: EOCCO reported nearly all its providers as serving strictly either adult or pediatric populations, with few providers documented as serving both. It was unclear from the analysis whether these practice characteristics were accurately reported in EOCCO\u2019s quarterly provider capacity data files. Additionally, EOCCO reported very low rates of providers operating within the service area or accepting new patients, with most providers accepting no new patients. Recommendations: EOCCO should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them.

Of the total responsive cases, 67.6 percent of the offices offered the requested services, 49.5 percent accepted OHP, 46.3 percent accepted EOCCO, and 37.2 percent accepted new patients. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of EOCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that EOCCO use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 25.5 percent resulted in an appointment. Although the appointment wait time compliance rate for PCDs was 100 percent, the overall rate for PCDs and PCPs combined was 68.8 percent. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of EOCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that EOCCO confirm appointment availability with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. EOCCO should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls. Revealed Telephone Survey Strength: Of the revealed telephone survey respondents with verified locations that offered the requested services, and accepted OHP and EOCCO, 97.2 percent of the offices offered translation or interpreter services to members. Weakness: Overall, 62.3 percent of the revealed telephone survey total sampled cases were reached, of which 13, or 13.1 percent, refused to participate in the survey. Of the total responsive cases, 77.8 percent of the offices confirmed the location, 62.6 percent offered the requested specialty, 57.6 percent accepted OHP, 36.4 percent accepted EOCCO, and 35.4 percent accepted new patients.

Weakness: Of the sampled cases, only 21.4 percent of the revealed telephone survey respondents offered a new patient appointment, while only 22.0 percent of survey respondents offered an appointment for an existing patient. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 72.5 percent of routine appointments and 47.8 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of EOCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that EOCCO confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. EOCCO should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: The EOCCO - submitted data exhibited high record-level data completeness, with low record omission and surplus rates. Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: The EOCCO - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (EOCCO and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the EOCCO-submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the EOCCO-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI",

Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the EOCCO-submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that EOCCO and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence. This adjustment will enhance the accuracy and completeness of the comparative analysis data. Additionally, it will provide HSAG with the means to verify and ensure the accuracy of the MMIS\u2019 process of populating the Rendering Provider NPI with the Billing Provider NPI . Mental Health Parity Evaluation Weakness: EOCCO was partially compliant with the Medical Management\u2014Concurrent Review NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: EOCCO did not provide its rationale for the assignment of the NQTL to both the IP and OP classifications for MH/SUD benefits and only to the IP classification for the M/S benefits. Recommendations: EOCCO should review its implementation of for OP MH/SUD services to ensure that the additional limitation based on the benefit does not impede the member\u2019s ability to access OP care more so than M/S. Weakness: EOCCO was partially compliant with the Medical Management\u2014Fail-First Requirements or Step Therapy NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: EOCCO did not provide its rationale for the assignment of the NQTL (i.e., lower cost options), procedures related to step therapy (e.g., individuals involved, factors used, professional guidelines used), or how frequently or strictly the NQTL is applied (e.g., decision-making process). Recommendations: EOCCO should identify processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors used in step therapy assignment for prescription drugs.

Why the weakness exists: Health Share failed to demonstrate appropriate oversight of its subcontractors and their processes and materials. Health Share\u2019s and/or its subcontractors\u2019 policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Additionally, Health Share failed to notify members of the person formally designated as primarily responsible for coordinating the services accessed by the member. Health Share also did not demonstrate mechanisms to ensure completion of the health risk screening. Health Share failed to demonstrate a streamlined method of assessing and reassessing members and updating the member\u2019s care plan within the appropriate time frame for members enrolled in case management. Finally, Health Share failed to share the required information to prevent duplication, coordinate between settings of care, ensure maintenance of professional standards, implement privacy procedures in the process of care coordination, and ensure direct access to specialists for members with SHCN. Recommendations: Health Share must revise its policies and procedures to align with federal and State requirements and demonstrate that its subcontractors have and implement the appropriate processes to ensure compliance with the requirements. Weakness: Health Share received a score of 44.4 percent in Standard IV\u2014Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting Health Share\u2019s ability to adhere to federal and State requirements for ensuring the appropriate authorization of services and to ensure proper and timely notification of adverse benefit determinations. Why the weakness exists: Health Share failed to demonstrate appropriate oversight of its subcontractors and their processes and materials. Health Share\u2019s and/or its subcontractors\u2019 policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements.

Health Share\u2019s data included subdivision by demographics, risk cohorts, and other factors including SDOH and climate change vulnerability. This monitoring directly informed network adequacy decision-making and strategic planning. Weakness: Health Share scored below 90 percent and below the CCO aggregate score in the DSN Monitoring and Analysis domain of the DSN Provider Narrative. Why the weakness exists: Health Share did not demonstrate compliance with state-established specialty provider taxonomy data and reporting requirements, monitor hours of operation, and demonstrate how it uses collected information on telehealth utilization to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making.

Why the weakness exists: Health Share reported moderate rates of providers operating within its service area and moderate to very low rates (i.e., SUD providers at 3.4 percent) of providers accepting new patients. Recommendations: Health Share should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them. Secret Shopper Survey Strength: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, 94.9 percent of PCD offices and 94.3 percent of PCP offices confirmed the location. Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 86.0 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the total responsive cases, 52.9 percent of the offices offered the requested services, 40.2 percent accepted OHP, 22.8 percent accepted Health Share, and 15.2 percent accepted new patients. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of Health Share\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that Health Share use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 13.8 percent resulted in an appointment. Although the appointment wait time compliance rate for PCPs was 100 percent, the overall rate for PCDs and PCPs combined was 78.9 percent. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of Health Share\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that Health Share confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients.

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-12 Weakness Revealed Telephone Survey Weakness: Overall, 40.3 percent of the revealed telephone survey total sampled cases were reached, of which nine, or 6.7 percent, refused to participate in the survey. Of the total responsive cases, 71.9 percent of the offices confirmed the location, 37.0 percent offered the requested specialty, 36.3 percent accepted OHP, 22.2 percent accepted Health Share, 16.3 percent accepted new patients, and 70.0 percent offered translation or interpreter services. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of Health Share\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that Health Share use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, program information, and translation/interpreter services offered). Weakness: Of the sampled cases, only 4.2 percent of the revealed telephone survey respondents offered a new patient appointment, while only 6.3 percent of survey respondents offered an appointment for an existing patient. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 85.3 percent of routine appointments and 45.7 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of Health Share\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that Health Share confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. Health Share should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability.",

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-12 Weakness Encounter Data Validation Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: The Health Share - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (Health Share and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: There were a high number and percentage of records present in the files submitted by OHA but not found in the files submitted by Health Share\u2019s subcontractor(s) (i.e., record surplus). Why the weakness exists: Based on the data discrepancy report response from Health Share, some of the surplus records were associated with its subcontractor, WDG. A high number of WDG records were excluded from analysis due to missing the required variable, Adjudication Date . Furthermore, Health Share noted a portion of the surplus records were D3 encounters that were inadvertently omitted from the data extract sent to HSAG. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that Health Share proactively inform HSAG about special scenarios like the one observed with WDG, where the Adjudication Date was not populated due to WDG\u2019s capitated nature, that it does not receive, process, or adjudicate claims. Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the Health Share- submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the Health Share-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the Health Share- submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that Health Share and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence.",

Why the weakness exists: IHN failed to demonstrate the implementation of health risk screenings according to State requirements. IHN also failed to implement mechanisms to ensure the appropriate maintenance of medical records in accordance with professional standards. Recommendations: IHN must demonstrate implementation of appropriate initial health risk screenings according to federal and State requirements. IHN must also implement mechanisms to ensure the appropriate maintenance of medical records in accordance with professional standards. Weakness: IHN received a score of 61.1 percent in Standard IV\u2014 Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting IHN\u2019s ability to adhere to federal and State requirements for authorizing services and to ensure proper and timely notification of adverse benefit determinations. Why the weakness exists: IHN\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Additionally, IHN demonstrated reversing service authorization decisions outside the appeal process. IHN also failed to adhere to requirements for appropriate decision- makers, monitoring for consistency of application of review criteria, proper outreach to obtain information needed to process authorization requests, readability, required content, and administering authorization decisions. Recommendations: IHN must revise its policies and procedures to align with federal and State requirements. IHN must demonstrate adherence to federal and State requirements for authorization of services and required content for notification of adverse benefit determinations. Weakness: IHN received a score of 70.0 percent in Standard VII\u2014 Member Rights and Protections due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate implementation of an established process, impacting IHN\u2019s ability to ensure that member rights are respected and",

Performance Improvement Projects Statewide Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP Weakness: IHN\u2019s narrative interpretation of indicator results included inaccuracies. Why the weakness exists: IHN did not align with the corrected baseline indicator in the narrative interpretation of results and report the correct decrease from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: IHN should ensure that all performance indicator data and interpretation of results are accurately and consistently reported throughout the PIP documentation. Weakness: IHN\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate any improvement over baseline performance. Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: IHN should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. IHN should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Strength: IHN successfully initiated the Implementation stage for the PIP, receiving a Met score for 100 percent of applicable evaluation elements in the PIP validation tool.

Why the weakness exists: IHN\u2019s MY 2022 performance on this measure indicator was not at the level of CCOs statewide (i.e., IHN\u2019s rate was below the statewide aggregate rate) and did not meet the performance threshold set by OHA. Recommendations: IHN should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted. Additionally, IHN should monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches for ensuring the timeliness and accessibility of health care services (e.g., telehealth strategies, mobile clinics). Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Weakness: IHN scored below 90 percent and below the CCO aggregate score overall and in three domains of the DSN Provider Narrative. Why the weakness exists: IHN failed to demonstrate compliance with state-established specialty provider taxonomy data and reporting requirements. IHN did not sufficiently describe or demonstrate how it uses collected information on member needs and populations or provider networks to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. IHN did not resolve all findings from the CY 2022 DSN Evaluation. Recommendations: IHN should ensure that all future reporting utilizes the state-established specialty provider taxonomies current to the review period, and should demonstrate how it collects and uses member and DSN data to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision- making. IHN should ensure that all network adequacy interventions include plans for assessing their efficacy. IHN should address all findings from prior DSN Evaluations. Weakness: IHN showed potential data and/or access issues within its provider and facility data, including active status, service area, and status of accepting new patients. Why the weakness exists: IHN reported moderate rates of providers active within its network, moderate to low rates of providers and facilities operating within its service area, and very high rates (i.e., at or close to 100 percent) of providers accepting new patients.",

Of the total responsive cases, 77.3 percent of the offices confirmed the location, 29.1 percent offered the requested services, 23.3 percent accepted OHP, 18.6 percent accepted IHN, and 14.0 percent accepted new patients. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of IHN\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that IHN use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 7.6 percent resulted in an appointment. Of the cases that offered an appointment, 61.5 percent were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of IHN\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that IHN confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. IHN should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls. Revealed Telephone Survey Weakness: Overall, 29.6 percent of the revealed telephone survey total sampled cases were reached, of which none refused to participate in the survey.

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-14 Weakness Recommendations: HSAG recommends that IHN use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the sampled cases, only 9.0 percent of the revealed telephone survey respondents offered a new patient appointment, while only 14.2 percent of survey respondents offered an appointment for an existing patient. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 80.9 percent of routine appointments and 69.8 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of IHN\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that IHN confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. IHN should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: Encounters that could be matched between data extracted from OHA\u2019s data warehouse and data extracted from IHN\u2019s or the subcontractor\u2019s data system exhibited a high level of element completeness (i.e., low element omission and surplus rates) for nearly all evaluated key data elements. Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Weakness: There were a high number and percentage of records present in the files submitted by OHA but not found in the files submitted by IHN\u2019s subcontractor(s) (i.e., record surplus). Why the weakness exists: Based on the data discrepancy report response from IHN, the surplus records were primarily associated with its subcontractors, Capitol Dental and WDG. Issues in Capitol Dental's data were attributed to a naming convention change during 2022. A high number of WDG records were excluded from analysis due to missing the required variable, Adjudication Date .",

Weakness: The all-element accuracy rate was low, indicating about 13 percent of records that are in both data sources do not have the same values (either missing or non-missing) for all key data elements. This issue is directly related to the high element surplus rate for Tooth Number , which is identified as another weakness. Why the weakness exists: The Tooth Number information that was captured in OHA\u2019s data, but not in IHN\u2019s data, suggests a potential loss in information after encounter submission to OHA. Recommendations: Since all Tooth Number surplus records were associated with Advantage Dental, HSAG recommends IHN to collaborate with Advantage Dental to actively address and resolve the issue. This may involve refining data entry processes, enhancing validation protocols, and conducting regular audits to ensure accurate and complete data for Tooth Number information. Mental Health Parity Evaluation Strength: IHN achieved full compliance with parity requirements for NQTLs applied to MH/SUD and M/S benefits.",

Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: JCC should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. JCC should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Weakness: JCC\u2019s documentation did not demonstrate significant clinical or programmatic improvement in processes and outcomes. Why the weakness exists: JCC did not complete the Clinical and Programmatic Improvement Table; therefore, no evidence was provided to demonstrate significant clinical or programmatic improvement. Recommendations: JCC should complete the Clinical and Programmatic Improvement Table to demonstrate significant clinical or programmatic improvement in processes and outcomes. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Weakness: JCC did not include accurate information in the data table in Step 7 and must update the baseline narrative section after obtaining the correct data.",

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-16 Weakness Why the weakness exists: JCC revised the baseline indicator results in the Step 7 Indicator Results table and narrative; however, the data differed from the OHA data file. Recommendations: JCC should correct the baseline indicator results in the Step 7 Indicator Results table and baseline narrative prior to submission for next year\u2019s validation in 2024. Performance Measure Validation Strength: JCC\u2019s MY 2022 performance on the Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services\u2014Ages 1 to 5 Years and Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicators improved by more than 5 percentage points compared to MY 2021; 6.1 percentage points for members ages 1 to 5 years and 6.5 percentage points for members ages 6 to 14 years. JCC\u2019s performance on this measure demonstrated ongoing improvement for members in both age groups since MY 2020. In addition, the CCO\u2019s MY 2022 rates in both age groups exceeded the 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more. Strength: JCC\u2019s performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020. Weakness: JCC\u2019s MY 2022 performance on the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator declined by more than 5 percentage points compared to MY 2021 (-5.7 percentage points). In addition, JCC\u2019s MY 2022 rate for this measure fell below the statewide aggregate and the 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more. Why the weakness exists: Although JCC\u2019s eligible population for this measure increased from MY 2021 to MY 2022, fewer children ages 3 to 6 years had a comprehensive well-care visit with their PCP in MY 2022 compared to MY 2021. OHA\u2019s 2022 CCO Performance Metrics Annual Report showed statewide performance for the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator declined slightly (0.6 percent) from MY 2021. Recommendations: JCC should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted. Additionally, JCC should monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches for ensuring the timeliness and accessibility of health care services (e.g., telehealth strategies, mobile clinics).

Why the weakness exists: In response to EQR recommendations, JCC noted several barriers to implementing performance improvement initiatives, including staffing shortages in its provider network and systemic barriers limiting access to care. Recommendations: In 2022, JCC monitored data on performance measures and conducted weekly internal meetings and monthly meetings with network providers to identify and address factors impacting performance. JCC should continue implementing these efforts to raise its rate on this measure indicator to the level of the benchmarks set by OHA. Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: JCC maintained and utilized frequently updated data dashboards of service utilization across multiple settings, subdivided by member demographics and risk cohorts, and available across divisions. Weakness: JCC demonstrated a moderate level of compliance with network monitoring requirements. Why the weakness exists: JCC did not demonstrate compliance with state-established specialty provider taxonomy data and reporting requirements. Additionally, JCC was not able to demonstrate how it collects and uses data on provider-to-member ratios, wait time to appointment availability, hours of operation, use of telehealth modalities, availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate care, or availability of physical accessibility accommodations to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. Recommendations: JCC should ensure that all future reporting utilizes the state-established specialty provider taxonomies current to the review period, and should demonstrate how it collects and uses DSN data to inform network adequacy monitoring and decision-making. Weakness: JCC showed potential issues within its provider data, including but not limited to service area activity and status of accepting new patients. This issue was also identified during the CY 2021 and CY 2022 DSN Evaluations and was not addressed by JCC. Why the weakness exists: The percentage of providers operating within the service area was approximately 10 percent or less for most providers including PCPs. With the exception of PCPs, less than 1 percent of all provider types were accepting new patients. Recommendations: JCC should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them.",

Strength: The JCC - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (JCC and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: There were a moderately high number and percentage of records present in the files submitted by OHA but not found in the files submitted by JCC\u2019s subcontractor(s) (i.e., record surplus).

Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the JCC-submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the JCC- submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the JCC-submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that JCC and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence. This adjustment will enhance the accuracy and completeness of the comparative analysis data. Additionally, it will provide HSAG with the means to verify and ensure the accuracy of the MMIS\u2019 process of populating the Rendering Provider NPI with the Billing Provider NPI .

Why the weakness exists: PCS-CO failed to demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Recommendations: PCS-CO must demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Performance Improvement Projects Statewide Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP Weakness: PCS-CO\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate any improvement over the baseline across all performance indicators. Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: PCS-CO should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. PCS-CO should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Strength: PCS-CO successfully initiated the Implementation stage for the PIP, receiving a Met score for 100 percent of applicable evaluation elements in the PIP validation tool. In the Implementation stage, PCS- CO accurately reported baseline performance indicator data; identified and analyzed barriers for initiation, engagement, and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders; and began to carry out interventions to address those barriers. Performance Measure Validation Strength: PCS-CO\u2019s MY 2022 performance for members ages 6 to 14 years receiving preventive dental or oral health services improved by more than 5 percentage points compared to MY 2021 (5.7 percentage points). The CCO\u2019s performance on the Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services\u2014Ages 1 to 5 Years and Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicators demonstrated ongoing improvement for members in both age groups since MY 2020. In addition, the CCO\u2019s MY 2022 rate for the Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicator exceeded the 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more.",

Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: PCS-CO demonstrated full compliance with all elements of the DSN Provider Narrative, showing a high degree of competency in its network adequacy processes, narrative responses, documentation, and overall organization of the deliverable submission. Strength: PCS-CO described and demonstrated sophisticated collection and use of member and provider information to support network adequacy monitoring and decision-making by both strategic bodies and smaller \u201cfront line\u201d teams. Weakness: PCS-CO\u2019s global reporting of nearly all provider data did not allow for a full assessment of the network available to members within specific CCOs. Why the weakness exists: With the exception of PCPs, all providers and their statuses were reported globally and were identical for all PCS CCOs, including but not limited to active status and accepting new patients status. Most providers were shown as operating outside of PCS-CO\u2019s service area. Recommendations: PCS-CO should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and take corrective action, as necessary. Secret Shopper Survey Strength: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, 100 percent of PCD offices and 91.1 percent of PCP offices confirmed the location.

Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of PCS-CO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-CO confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. PCS-CO should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: PCS-CO - submitted data exhibited high record-level data completeness, with low record omission and surplus rates. Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: PCS-CO - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (PCS-CO and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-CO-submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the PCS- CO-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-CO-submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that PCS-CO and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are",

Why the weakness exists: PCS-CG\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with State requirements. Additionally, PCS-CG failed to demonstrate a streamlined method of assessing and reassessing members and updating the care plan within the appropriate time frame for members enrolled in ICC. Recommendations: PCS-CG must revise its policies and procedures to align with State requirements. PCS-CG must also demonstrate implementation of appropriate assessments, reassessments, and revision of treatment plans according to federal and State requirements. Weakness: PCS-CG received a score of 77.8 percent in Standard IV\u2014 Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting PCS-CG\u2019s ability to ensure the appropriate services and coverage are offered to members. Why the weakness exists: PCS-CG\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements.

Why the weakness exists: PCS-CG failed to demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Recommendations: PCS-CG must demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Performance Improvement Projects Statewide Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP Weakness: PCS-CG\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate any improvement over baseline performance. Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: PCS-CG should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. PCS-CG should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Strength: PCS-CG successfully initiated the Implementation stage for the PIP, receiving a Met score for 100 percent of applicable evaluation elements in the PIP validation tool. In the Implementation stage, PCS- CG accurately reported baseline performance indicator data; identified and analyzed barriers for initiation, engagement, and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders; and began to carry out interventions to address those barriers.

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-20 Weakness slightly compared to MY 2021, specifically for members ages 6 to 14 years (-1.5 percentage points). Why the weakness exists: PCS-CG demonstrated substantial improvement in performance on this measure between MY 2020 and MY 2021 (8.4 percentage points for members ages 6 to 14 years); however, PCS-CG did not continue to perform well on this measure in MY 2022. Despite statewide improvement in this measure for members ages 1 to 5 years, PCS-CG demonstrated no improvement and continued to perform below the OHA benchmark. Recommendations: PCS-CG should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted. Additionally, PCS-CG should monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches for ensuring the timeliness and accessibility of health care services (e.g., telehealth strategies, mobile clinics). Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: PCS-CG demonstrated full compliance with all elements of the DSN Provider Narrative, showing a high degree of competency in its network adequacy processes, narrative responses, documentation, and overall organization of the deliverable submission. Strength: PCS-CG described and demonstrated sophisticated collection and use of member and provider information to support network adequacy monitoring and decision-making by both strategic bodies and smaller \u201cfront line\u201d teams. Weakness: PCS-CG\u2019s global reporting of almost all provider data did not allow for a full assessment of the network available to members within specific CCOs. Why the weakness exists: With the exception of PCPs, all providers and their statuses were reported globally and were identical for all PCS CCOs, including but not limited to active status and accepting new patients status. Nearly all providers were shown as operating outside of PCS-CG\u2019s service area. Recommendations: PCS-CG should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and take corrective action, as necessary.

Although 100 percent of the PCD cases confirmed the location and offered the requested services, PCP offices confirmed the location for 62.5 percent of the cases and offered the requested services for 35.9 percent of the cases. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of PCS-CG\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-CG use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 5.1 percent resulted in an appointment. Of the cases that offered an appointment, 50.0 percent were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of PCS-CG\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-CG confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients.

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-20 Weakness information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the sampled cases, only 8.2 percent of the revealed telephone survey respondents offered an appointment to new or existing patients, each. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 80.0 percent of routine appointments and 50.0 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of PCS-CG\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-CG confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. PCS-CG should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: PCS-CG - submitted data exhibited high record-level data completeness, with low record omission and surplus rates. Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: PCS-CG - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (PCS-CG and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-CG-submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the PCS- CG-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-CG-submitted data.",

To address this, HSAG recommends that PCS-CG and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence. This adjustment will enhance the accuracy and completeness of the comparative analysis data. Additionally, it will provide HSAG with the means to verify and ensure the accuracy of the MMIS\u2019 process of populating the Rendering Provider NPI with the Billing Provider NPI . Mental Health Parity Evaluation Weakness: PCS-CG was partially compliant with the Pharmacy Management\u2014Formulary Design NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: PCS-CG did not provide its rationale for the assignment of the NQTL (i.e., prescription drug formulary), procedures used for the development of the formulary (e.g., individuals involved in formulary development, professional guidelines used, and how often the formulary is reviewed and updated or by whom), or how frequently or strictly the NQTL is applied (e.g., ability of the provider to request an exception). Recommendations: PCS-CG should identify processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors that are used in formulary design and the application for prescription drugs. Weakness: PCS-CG was partially compliant with the Pharmacy Management\u2014Prescription Drug Benefit Tiers NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: PCS-CG did not provide its rationale for the assignment of the NQTL (i.e., formulary drug tiering), procedures related to formulary tiering (e.g., individuals involved, factors used to determine tier placement, or professional guidelines used), or how frequently or strictly the NQTL is applied (e.g., decision-making process). Recommendations: PCS-CG should identify processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors that are used in formulary tiering. Weakness: PCS-CG showed a substantial difference in the percentage of paid, out-of-network MH/SUD OP claims compared to M/S OP claims. Although the difference in the percentage of paid claims may be legitimate, it may also highlight procedural or network differences, indicating potential barriers for members accessing MH/SUD services. Why the weakness exists: Out-of-network OP MH/SUD claims were paid less frequently than M/S claims.",

Why the weakness exists: PCS-Lane failed to demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Recommendations: PCS-Lane must demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Performance Improvement Projects Statewide Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP Weakness: PCS-Lane\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate any improvement over baseline performance. Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: PCS-Lane should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. PCS- Lane should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Strength: PCS-Lane successfully initiated the Implementation stage for the PIP, receiving a Met score for 100 percent of applicable evaluation elements in the PIP validation tool. In the Implementation stage, PCS- Lane accurately reported baseline performance indicator data; identified and analyzed barriers for initiation, engagement, and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders; and began to carry out interventions to address those barriers. Performance Measure Validation Strength: PCS-Lane\u2019s MY 2022 performance for members ages 6 to 14 years receiving preventive dental or oral health services improved by more than 5 percentage points compared to MY 2021 (5.5 percentage points). The CCO\u2019s performance on the Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services\u2014Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicators demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020. In addition, the CCO\u2019s MY 2022 rate for the Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicator exceeded the statewide aggregate and the 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more.",

Strength: PCS-Lane\u2019s performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020. Weakness: PCS-Lane\u2019s MY 2022 rate for the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator fell below the statewide aggregate and the 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more. Why the weakness exists: PCS-Lane\u2019s performance on this measure declined slightly compared to MY 2021 (-1.7 percentage points). Although PCS-Lane\u2019s eligible population for this measure increased from MY 2021 to MY 2022, nearly the same number of children ages 3 to 6 years had a comprehensive well-care visit with their PCP in both MY 2021 and MY 2022. OHA\u2019s 2022 CCO Performance Metrics Annual Report showed statewide performance for the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator declined slightly (0.6 percent) from MY 2021. Recommendations: PCS-Lane should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted. Additionally, PCS-Lane should monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches for ensuring the timeliness and accessibility of health care services (e.g., telehealth strategies, mobile clinics). Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: PCS-Lane demonstrated full compliance with all elements of the DSN Provider Narrative, showing a high degree of competency in its network adequacy processes, narrative responses, documentation, and overall organization of the deliverable submission. Strength: PCS-Lane described and demonstrated sophisticated collection and use of member and provider information to support network adequacy monitoring and decision-making by both strategic bodies and smaller \u201cfront line\u201d teams.",

Why the weakness exists: With the exception of PCPs, all providers and their statuses were reported globally and were identical for all PCS CCOs, including but not limited to active status and accepting new patients status. Most providers were shown as operating outside of PCS-Lane\u2019s service area. Recommendations: PCS-Lane should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and take corrective action, as necessary. Secret Shopper Survey Strength: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, 96.0 percent of the PCD offices and 93.8 percent of the PCP offices confirmed the location. Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 88.1 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the total responsive cases, 43.9 percent of the offices offered the requested services, 31.6 percent accepted OHP, 24.5 percent accepted PCS-Lane, and 18.1 percent accepted new patients. While 96.0 percent of the PCD cases offered the requested services, the percentage of PCP offices offering the requested services was only 33.8 percent. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of PCS-Lane\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-Lane use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 13.1 percent of the PCP cases and 0.0 percent of the PCD cases resulted in an appointment. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of PCS-Lane\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate.

Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-Lane-submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the PCS- Lane-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-Lane-submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that PCS-Lane and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence. This adjustment will enhance the accuracy and completeness of the comparative analysis data. Additionally, it will provide HSAG with the means to verify and ensure the accuracy of the MMIS\u2019 process of populating the Rendering Provider NPI with the Billing Provider NPI .

Why the weakness exists: Out-of-network IP and OP MH/SUD claims were paid less frequently than M/S claims. Recommendations: PCS-Lane should review out-of-network claim denials to understand the factors affecting the lower percentage of paid MH/SUD OP claims compared to M/S OP claims. PCS-Lane should assess whether any barriers exist for members accessing MH/SUD services, including the need to seek services outside of the CCO\u2019s network (e.g., appointment availability).",

Why the weakness exists: PCS-MP\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with State requirements. Additionally, PCS-MP failed to demonstrate a streamlined method of assessing and reassessing members and updating the care plan within the appropriate time frame for members enrolled in ICC. Recommendations: PCS-MP must revise its policies and procedures to align with State requirements. PCS-MP must also demonstrate implementation of appropriate assessments, reassessments, and revision of treatment plans according to federal and State requirements.

Why the weakness exists: PCS-MP failed to demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Recommendations: PCS-MP must demonstrate evidence of processes to ensure payment of emergency and poststabilization services. Performance Improvement Projects Statewide Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP Weakness: PCS-MP\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate improvement or statistically significant improvement over the baseline across all performance indicators. Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: PCS-MP should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. PCS-MP should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Strength: PCS-MP successfully initiated the Implementation stage for the PIP, receiving a Met score for 100 percent of applicable evaluation elements in the PIP validation tool. In the Implementation stage, PCS- MP accurately reported baseline performance indicator data; identified and analyzed barriers for initiation, engagement, and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders; and began to carry out interventions to address those barriers.

Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: PCS-MP demonstrated full compliance with all elements of the DSN Provider Narrative, showing a high degree of competency in its network adequacy processes, narrative responses, documentation, and overall organization of the deliverable submission. Strength: PCS-MP described and demonstrated sophisticated collection and use of member and provider information to support network adequacy monitoring and decision-making by both strategic bodies and smaller \u201cfront line\u201d teams. Weakness: PCS-MP\u2019s global reporting of almost all provider data did not allow for a full assessment of the network available to members within specific CCOs. Why the weakness exists: With the exception of PCPs, all providers and their statuses were reported globally and were identical for all PCS CCOs, including but not limited to active status and accepting new patients status. Most providers were shown as operating outside of PCS-MP\u2019s service area. Recommendations: PCS-MP should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and take corrective action, as necessary. Secret Shopper Survey Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 75.5 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the total responsive cases, 86.7 percent of the offices confirmed the location, 44.2 percent of the offices offered the requested services, 33.3 percent accepted OHP, 23.3 percent accepted PCS-MP, and 16.7 percent accepted new patients. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of PCS-MP\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-MP use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 11.7 percent resulted in an appointment. Of the cases that offered an",

Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-MP use the case- level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, program information, and translation/interpreter services offered). Weakness: Of the sampled cases, only 5.7 percent of the revealed telephone survey respondents offered a new patient appointment, while only 14.9 percent of survey respondents offered an appointment for an existing patient. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 69.4 percent of routine appointments and 46.9 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of PCS-MP\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that PCS-MP confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. PCS-MP should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified",

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-24 Weakness during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: PCS-MP - submitted data exhibited high record-level data completeness, with low record omission and surplus rates. Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: PCS-MP - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (PCS-MP and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-MP-submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the PCS- MP-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the PCS-MP-submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that PCS-MP and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence. This adjustment will enhance the accuracy and completeness of the comparative analysis data. Additionally, it will provide HSAG with the means to verify and ensure the accuracy of the MMIS\u2019 process of populating the Rendering Provider NPI with the Billing Provider NPI . Mental Health Parity Evaluation Weakness: PCS-MP was partially compliant with the Pharmacy Management\u2014Formulary Design NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: PCS-MP did not provide its rationale for the assignment of the NQTL (i.e., prescription drug formulary), procedures",

Recommendations: PCS-MP should review out-of-network claim denials to understand factors affecting the lower percentage of paid MH/SUD OP claims compared to M/S OP claims.

TCHP- North should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Strength: TCHP-North successfully initiated the Implementation stage for the PIP, receiving a Met score for 100 percent of applicable evaluation elements in the PIP validation tool. In the Implementation stage, TCHP-North accurately reported baseline performance indicator data; identified and analyzed barriers for initiation, engagement, and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders; and began to carry out interventions to address those barriers. Performance Measure Validation Strength: TCHP-North\u2019s MY 2022 performance for members ages 1 to 5 years receiving preventive dental or oral health services improved by more than 5 percentage points compared to MY 2021 (7.5 percentage points). Weakness: TCHP-North\u2019s MY 2022 rate on the Initiation of SUD Treatment measure indicator for members ages 18 years and older fell below the 2020 HEDIS national Medicaid median benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022. Why the weakness exists: TCHP-North\u2019s performance on this measure indicator suggests there are barriers impacting efforts to initiate treatment for members diagnosed with SUD. Recommendations: TCHP-North should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted. Additionally, TCHP-North should monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches for ensuring the",

Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: TCHP-North showed substantial improvement in the overall quality and completeness of its DSN Provider Narrative Template responses and documentation, continuing a trend from the CY 2021 DSN Evaluation. This allowed for a fuller understanding and more accurate evaluation of its network adequacy processes and status. TCHP-North\u2019s continued improvement was due in part to TCHP- North\u2019s responsivity to feedback as well as proactive outreach for technical assistance. Weakness: TCHP-North showed potential issues within its provider data, including but not limited to provider counts and status of accepting new patients. Why the weakness exists: TCHP-North\u2019s provider data showed multiple substantial increases and decreases in provider counts between Q2 2022 and Q1 2023, indicating potential data issues, potential barriers to care, or both. With the exception of PCDs, all providers were listed as having 100 percent acceptance of new patients, indicating potential data issues. Recommendations: TCHP-North should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them. Weakness: TCHP-North showed potential data issues and/or barriers to access to primary dental and BH services that were not substantively addressed within its DSN Provider Narrative Template. Why the weakness exists: A moderate to low percentage of both MHP and SUD providers were determined to be active in TCHP-North\u2019s network within the prior two years. A low percentage of TCHP-North\u2019s PCDs were listed as accepting new patients. These results indicated potential data issues, potential barriers to access to care, or both. Recommendations: TCHP-North should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them.

Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 73.7 percent of routine appointments and 56.3 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of TCHP-North\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that TCHP-North confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. TCHP-North should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: TCHP-North - submitted data exhibited high record-level data completeness, with low record omission and surplus rates. Weakness: The Rendering Provider NPI showed that information was present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the TCHP-North- submitted data. Why the weakness exists: More than 99.9 percent of the Rendering Provider NPI values in the OHA-submitted data, not found in the TCHP-North-submitted data, had the same values as the Billing Provider NPI . This discrepancy is likely a result of the data processing approach in OHA\u2019s MMIS. In OHA\u2019s MMIS, if the Rendering Provider NPI value is not submitted, the system populates the value with the Billing Provider NPI value. Consequently, when comparing this data element across the two sources, the Rendering Provider NPI is present in the OHA-submitted data but not in the TCHP-North- submitted data. Recommendations: While encounter submission to OHA did not require the inclusion of the Rendering Provider NPI value if it matched the Billing Provider NPI value, the data request for the EDV comparative analysis had different requirements. To address this, HSAG recommends that TCHP-North and its subcontractor(s) ensure that values for both Billing Provider NPI and Rendering Provider NPI are included in the data submission, irrespective of their equivalence. This adjustment will enhance the accuracy and completeness of the comparative analysis data. Additionally, it will provide HSAG with the means to verify and ensure the accuracy of the MMIS\u2019 process of populating the Rendering Provider NPI with the Billing Provider NPI .",

This issue is directly related to other identified weaknesses: the high element omission rates for Tooth Number and Tooth Surface 1 , and the low accuracy rates for CDT Code , Tooth Number , and Tooth Surface 1 through Tooth Surface 4. Why the weakness exists: The underlying cause of the issues is related to the CCO-submitted data for Capitol Dental, where misalignment occurred for multiple data elements, leading to inaccurate matching of fields. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that TCHP-North implement standardized quality controls to ensure data are accurately aligned in its data extracts from their encounter data system(s). However, it is also important to note that in the data requirements document, HSAG requested data to be extracted from the CCOs\u2019 subcontractors\u2019 data systems and was anticipating three distinct data extracts from TCHP- North\u2019s subcontractors. Instead, TCHP-North stacked all data extracts before submission to HSAG, rather than submitting the raw data extracts directly received from the subcontractors. The stacking of the data caused the misalignment observed in Capitol Dental Care\u2019s data. To address this, HSAG suggests submitting the raw data extracts separately, maintaining the integrity of the original data and avoiding misalignments during the stacking process.

Weakness: TCHP-South received a score of 94.4 percent in Standard III\u2014Coordination and Continuity of Care due to failure to appropriately assess/reassess members for care coordination services. Why the weakness exists: TCHP-South failed to demonstrate that health risk screenings are conducted appropriately. TCHP-South also failed to demonstrate the appropriate outreach attempts and compliance with state-established time frames for assessing and reassessing members enrolled in ICC. Recommendations: TCHP-South must demonstrate implementation of appropriate assessments and reassessments, according to federal and State requirements. TCHP-South must also demonstrate compliance with its policies, specifically for outreach attempts to members for care coordination services. Weakness: THCP-South received a score of 61.1 percent in Standard IV\u2014Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting TCHP-South\u2019s ability to adhere to federal and State requirements for authorizing services, and to ensure proper and timely notification of adverse benefit determinations. Why the weakness exists: TCHP-South\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Additionally, TCHP- South failed to adhere to requirements for the appropriate decision- makers and demonstrated reversing service authorization decisions outside the appeal process. TCHP-South also failed to adhere to requirements for required content and time frames for notification of adverse benefit determinations. Recommendations: TCHP-South must revise its policies and procedures to align with federal and State requirements. TCHP-South must also demonstrate the implementation of appropriate service offerings.

Performance Improvement Projects Statewide Mental Health Service Access Monitoring PIP Weakness: TCHP-South did not report accurate RY 1 performance indicator results. Why the weakness exists: TCHP-South\u2019s reported RY 1 indicator data and statistical testing results could not be replicated. Recommendations: TCHP-South should ensure all indicator data and statistical testing results are accurately and consistently reported throughout the PIP documentation. Weakness: TCHP-South did not report a complete interpretation of RY 1 indicator results. Why the weakness exists: TCHP-South did not state in the narrative whether the RY 1 results represented an improvement or decline in performance compared to baseline results, and whether the change was statistically significant. Recommendations: TCHP-South should revise the RY 1 narrative and ensure it aligns with the RY 1 data reported in the Step 7 table of the resubmission. TCHP-South should state in the narrative whether the RY 1 results represented an improvement or decline in performance compared to baseline results, and whether the change was statistically significant. Weakness: TCHP-South\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate any improvement over baseline performance. Why the weakness exists: The indicator results demonstrated a decline in performance from baseline to RY 1. Recommendations: TCHP-South should revisit root cause analyses identifying barriers to improving access to MH services to determine which barriers to improvement were not effectively addressed. TCHP- South should use intervention-specific evaluation results and updated barrier analyses to identify new or revised interventions with the potential to improve indicator results. Statewide Substance Use Disorder PIP Strength: TCHP-South successfully initiated the Implementation stage for the PIP, receiving a Met score for 100 percent of applicable evaluation elements in the PIP validation tool. In the Implementation stage, TCHP-South accurately reported baseline performance indicator data; identified and analyzed barriers for initiation, engagement, and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders; and began to carry out interventions to address those barriers.",

This allowed for a fuller understanding and more accurate evaluation of its network adequacy processes and status. TCHP-South\u2019s continued improvement was due in part to TCHP- South\u2019s responsivity to feedback as well as proactive outreach for technical assistance. Weakness: TCHP-South showed potential issues within its provider data, including but not limited to provider counts and status of accepting new patients. Why the weakness exists: TCHP-South\u2019s provider data showed multiple substantial increases and decreases in provider counts between Q2 2022 and Q1 2023, indicating potential data issues, potential barriers to care, or both.

Recommendations: TCHP-South should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them. Secret Shopper Survey Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 71.5 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the total responsive cases, 56.1 percent of the offices offered the requested services, 49.6 percent accepted OHP, 30.9 percent accepted TCHP-South, and 28.5 percent accepted new patients. However, while 97.4 percent of PCD offices confirmed the location, the rate for PCP offices was 80.0 percent. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of TCHP-South\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that TCHP-South use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 13.8 percent resulted in an appointment. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of TCHP-South\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that TCHP-South confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. TCHP-South should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls. Revealed Telephone Survey Weakness: Overall, 38.0 percent of the revealed telephone survey total sampled cases were reached, of which six, or 8.8 percent, refused to participate in the survey. Of the total responsive cases, 72.1 percent of the offices offered the requested specialty, 70.6 percent accepted OHP, 63.2 percent accepted TCHP-South, 58.8 percent accepted new patients, and 67.4 percent offered translation or interpreter services.

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-28 Weakness Recommendations: HSAG recommends that TCHP-South use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, program information, and translation/interpreter services offered). Weakness: Of the sampled cases, only 11.2 percent of the survey respondents offered a new patient appointment, while only 16.2 percent of survey respondents offered an appointment for an existing patient. Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 92.7 percent of routine appointments and 47.9 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of TCHP-South\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that TCHP-South confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. TCHP-South should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability. Encounter Data Validation Strength: Encounters that could be matched between data extracted from OHA\u2019s data warehouse and data extracted from TCHP-South\u2019s or the subcontractor\u2019s data system exhibited a high level of element completeness (i.e., low element omission and surplus rates) for nearly all evaluated key data elements. Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: TCHP-South - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (TCHP-South and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Weakness: There were a moderately high number and percentage of records present in the files submitted by OHA but not found in the files submitted by TCHP-South\u2019s subcontractor(s) (i.e., record surplus).",

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-28 Weakness Why the weakness exists: Based on the data discrepancy report response, TCHP-South explained the surplus records identified were adjusted to have a claim status of \u201cvoid\u201d after their data submission to OHA, which resulted in those records not being sent to HSAG since voided claims are not part of the comparative analysis data requirements. Recommendations: HSAG recommends TCHP-South follow the submission guidance outlined in the data requirements document, which indicated, \u201cOnly include claims and encounters that are in a final, fully adjudicated status as of May 31, 2023.\u201d This would ensure HSAG receives encounters with the same claim status from the anchor date of May 31, 2023. Weakness: TCHP-South stacked all data extracts before submitting them to HSAG, instead of directly submitting the raw data extracts received from the subcontractors. Why the weakness exists: Stacking of the data before submission introduces an additional step in the data handling process. This intermediate step may increase the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies during the compilation, potentially affecting the accuracy and integrity of the data submitted to HSAG; for example, it may cause misalignment in data fields in one or more of the subcontractor-submitted data extracts. Recommendations: To address this, HSAG suggests submitting the raw data extracts separately, maintaining the integrity of the original data and preventing potential misalignments during the stacking process. Additionally, HSAG recommends TCHP-South establish robust quality checks during the data compilation phase to promptly identify and address any discrepancies. This proactive approach will contribute to maintaining data accuracy and reliability throughout the submission process. Mental Health Parity Evaluation Strength: TCHP-South achieved full compliance with parity requirements for application of NQTLs applied to MH/SUD and M/S benefits.",

Weakness: UHA received a score of 94.4 percent in Standard III\u2014 Coordination and Continuity of Care due to failure to appropriately assess/reassess members for care management and ICC services. Why the weakness exists: UHA failed to demonstrate completion of appropriate assessments/reassessments and treatment plan development in accordance with federal and State requirements. Recommendations: UHA must demonstrate assessments and reassessments, and development and revision of treatment plans according to federal and State requirements. Weakness: UHA received a score of 86.1 percent in Standard IV\u2014 Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting UHA\u2019s ability to adhere to federal and State requirements for authorizing services and to ensure proper and timely notification of adverse benefit determinations. Why the weakness exists: UHA\u2019s policies and procedures did not align with federal and State requirements. Additionally, UHA failed to adhere to requirements for decision-makers, and required content and time frames for notification of adverse benefit determinations.

Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: UHA described and demonstrated a rigorous approach to using data on members with physical, intellectual, and developmental disabilities to monitor and adjust its network with regard to the needs of the population as well as support individual members via care coordination. Weakness: Results showed potentially broad issues with UHA\u2019s provider capacity data, impacting a full evaluation of UHA\u2019s DSN, and raising concerns about data issues and barriers to access to care. Why the weakness exists: UHA\u2019s provider data showed substantial increases and decreases in most provider counts between Q2 2022 and Q1 2023. UHA\u2019s percentages of providers with active status, operating within the service area, and accepting new patients were widely varied and, in some cases, potentially contradictory (e.g., SUD providers). With the exception of PCDs, all providers were listed as having 100 percent acceptance of new patients, indicating potential data issues. Recommendations: UHA should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them. Secret Shopper Survey Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 75.0 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the total responsive cases, 45.5 percent of offices accepted OHP, 42.4 percent accepted UHA, and 30.3 percent accepted new patients. However, while 100 percent of the PCD offices confirmed the location and offered the requested services, the rates for the PCP offices were 88.0 percent and 40.0 percent, respectively. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of UHA\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that UHA use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information).

Strength: Encounters that could be matched between data extracted from OHA\u2019s data warehouse and data extracted from UHA\u2019s or the subcontractor\u2019s data system exhibited a high level of element completeness (i.e., low element omission and surplus rates) across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: The UHA - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non-missing) in both data sources (UHA and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Mental Health Parity Evaluation Strength: UHA provided comprehensive responses in the MHP Treatment Limitation Review Tool, including narrative responses to the questionnaire and explanations in the subsections to clarify information as needed. Weakness: UHA was partially compliant with the Pharmacy Management\u2014Formulary Design NQTL requirement. Why the weakness exists: UHA did not provide its rationale for the assignment of the NQTL (i.e., prescription drug formulary), procedures used for the development formulary (e.g., individuals involved in formulary development, professional guidelines used, or how often the formulary is reviewed and updated or by whom), or how frequently or strictly the NQTL is applied (e.g., ability of the provider to request an exception). Recommendations: UHA should identify processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors used in formulary design and the application for prescription drugs. Weakness: UHA showed substantial differences in the percentages of paid, out-of-network MH/SUD OP claims compared to M/S OP claims.

Why the weakness exists: YCCO failed to demonstrate a streamlined method of assessing and reassessing members and updating the member\u2019s care plan within the appropriate time frames. YCCO also failed to implement mechanisms to ensure the appropriate maintenance of medical records in accordance with professional standards. Recommendations: YCCO must demonstrate implementation of appropriate assessments, reassessments, and revision of treatment plans according to federal and State requirements. YCCO must also implement mechanisms to ensure the appropriate maintenance of medical records in accordance with professional standards. Weakness: YCCO received a score of 66.7 percent in Standard IV\u2014 Coverage and Authorization of Services due to a lack of operational structure and failure to demonstrate appropriate implementation, impacting YCCO\u2019s ability to ensure the appropriate services offered to members, appropriate and consistent coverage determinations, and proper and timely notification of adverse benefit determinations.

Recommendations: YCCO should ensure all indicator data and statistical testing results are accurately and consistently reported throughout the PIP documentation. Weakness: YCCO did not report accurate results of statistical testing comparing remeasurement results to baseline results. Why the weakness exists: YCCO\u2019s reported p value comparing overall baseline and RY 1 results was based on the incorrect baseline indicator data in the narrative interpretation of results. YCCO also did not revise the RY 1 narrative. Recommendations: YCCO should ensure statistical testing used to compare baseline and remeasurement results is appropriate and accurate. Weakness: YCCO\u2019s interpretation of indicator results was incomplete. Why the weakness exists: YCCO did not discuss whether factors were identified that may threaten the validity of the RY 1 results or the ability to compare baseline and RY 1 results.

Weakness: YCCO\u2019s reported indicator results did not demonstrate any improvement over baseline performance. Why the weakness exists: There was no improvement in indicator results from baseline to RY 1.

In the Implementation stage, YCCO accurately reported baseline performance indicator data; identified and analyzed barriers for initiation, engagement, and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders; and began to carry out interventions to address those barriers. Performance Measure Validation Strength: YCCO\u2019s MY 2022 performance on the Child and Adolescent Well-Care Visits\u2014Ages 3 to 6 Years measure indicator demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020. In addition, the CCO\u2019s MY 2022 rate for this measure exceeded the statewide aggregate and 2020 CCO 75th percentile benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022 by 5 percentage points or more. Strength: YCCO\u2019s MY 2022 performance on the Members Receiving Preventive Dental or Oral Health Services\u2014Ages 1 to 5 Years and Ages 6 to 14 Years measure indicators demonstrated ongoing improvement for members ages 6 to 14 years since MY 2020. Strength: YCCO\u2019s performance on the Oral Evaluation for Adults With Diabetes measure demonstrated ongoing improvement since MY 2020. Weakness: YCCO\u2019s MY 2022 rate on the Initiation of SUD Treatment measure indicator for members ages 18 years and older fell below the 2020 HEDIS national Medicaid median benchmark set by OHA for MY 2022. Why the weakness exists: YCCO\u2019s performance on this measure indicator suggests there are barriers impacting efforts to initiate treatment for members diagnosed with SUD. Recommendations: YCCO should conduct root cause analyses to identify specific factors affecting performance on this measure and develop, implement, and evaluate targeted interventions to ensure improvement strategies are adopted. Additionally, YCCO should monitor its provider network to identify gaps in access to care and work with providers to identify alternative approaches for ensuring the timeliness and accessibility of health care services (e.g., telehealth strategies, mobile clinics).",

    "text": "Strength/ Description Domain(s) 5-32 Weakness Validation of Network Adequacy Delivery System Network Evaluation Strength: Although YCCO did not achieve a high compliance score for its CY 2023 DSN Provider Narrative submission, both the overall quality of submitted documentation and the implementation of substantial process reforms demonstrated YCCO\u2019s commitment to improvement and responsiveness to feedback. YCCO showed that, while it still had room for growth in regard to network adequacy monitoring and decision-making, such improvements were specific to individual activities and requirements rather than overall approach. Weakness: YCCO showed potential issues within its provider data, including but not limited to provider counts, service area operations, and status of accepting new patients. Why the weakness exists: YCCO\u2019s provider data showed multiple substantial increases and decreases in provider counts between Q2 2022 and Q1 2023, indicating potential data issues, potential barriers to care, or both. With the exception of PCDs, all providers were listed as having 100 percent acceptance of new patients, indicating potential data issues. Recommendations: YCCO should seek technical assistance with OHA to determine the nature of the provider capacity data issues and correct them. Secret Shopper Survey Weakness: The total secret shopper survey response rate was 79.0 percent across all PCP and PCD cases. Of the total responsive cases, 81.3 percent of the offices confirmed the location, 25.2 percent offered the requested services, 10.7 percent accepted OHP, 9.3 percent accepted YCCO, and 7.5 percent accepted new patients. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of YCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low response rate and accuracy results. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that YCCO use the case-level analytic data files to address the data deficiencies identified during the secret shopper survey calls (e.g., incorrect or disconnected telephone numbers; incorrect addresses; and provider specialty information that does not correspond to the sampled location, plan name, and program information). Weakness: Of the total secret shopper survey responsive cases, only 3.3 percent resulted in an appointment. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the secret shopper approach, the accuracy of YCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate.",

Of the total responsive cases, 79.5 percent of the offices confirmed the location, 56.3 percent offered the requested specialty, 52.7 percent accepted OHP, 33.9 percent accepted YCCO, and 32.1 percent accepted new patients.

Of the total cases that offered an appointment, 78.6 percent of routine appointments and 60.7 percent of urgent appointments were within the wait time compliance standard. Why the weakness exists: In addition to limitations related to the revealed telephone approach, the accuracy of YCCO\u2019s provider data may have contributed to the low appointment availability rate. Additionally, internal office staffing structures and procedures may have contributed to the long wait times. Recommendations: HSAG recommends that YCCO confirm appointment availability and scheduling procedures with providers, including panel capacity to accept new patients. YCCO should use the case-level analytic data files containing data deficiencies identified during the revealed telephone survey calls and work with BH outpatient offices to identify the root cause for delays in appointment availability.

Strength: Among records that could be matched between the two data sources, a high level of element accuracy (i.e., data elements from both sources had the same values when populated) was exhibited across all evaluated key data elements. Strength: YCCO - submitted data had high all-element accuracy for all evaluated key data elements, indicating that the values (missing or non- missing) in both data sources (YCCO and OHA) were the same for almost all records. Mental Health Parity Evaluation Strength: YCCO achieved full compliance with parity requirements for application of NQTLs applied to MH/SUD and M/S benefits. Weakness: YCCO reported conflicting information in the MHP Treatment Limitation Review Tool. Why the weakness exists: YCCO reported it has not applied the practice guideline criteria for treatment limitation to any service classification of MH/SUD benefits; however, YCCO listed that clinical practice guidelines are utilized to make medical necessity determinations for MH/SUD benefits in the Availability of Information, Section 6, of the MHP Treatment Limitation Review Tool. Recommendations: YCCO should identify all treatment limitations applied to MH/SUD benefits. Weakness: YCCO showed substantial differences in the percentages of paid, out-of-network MH/SUD IP and OP claims compared to M/S IP and OP claims. Although differences in the percentage of paid claims may be legitimate, they may also highlight procedural or network differences indicating potential barriers to members\u2019 access to MH/SUD services. Why the weakness exists: Out-of-network IP and OP MH/SUD claims were paid less frequently than M/S claims. Recommendations: YCCO should review out-of-network claim denials to understand the factors affecting the lower percentages of paid MH/SUD IP and OP claims compared to M/S IP and OP claims. YCCO should assess whether any barriers exist for members accessing MH/SUD services, including the need to seek services outside the CCO's network (e.g., appointment availability).",

    "text": "First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario\u2019s 5000+ public libraries, university, college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries. Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at home or at a public library), enter college or university with a knowledge of how to use electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these skills and resources at work or at home. We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society. The concept of an ODL is a key element in The Roadmap to Prosperity , a strategic plan to envision and attain Ontario\u2019s economic goal prepared by the Ontario Jobs and Investment Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to \u201cconnect students to new workplaces, new sources of information and applied learning opportunities\u201d. The ODL will do that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as they make decisions, solve problems and enhance their quality of life. Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that delivery point to move closer to citizens, into the smallest of libraries and even into living rooms. Libraries have a long tradition of using a practical, consultative approach to solving problems, and of learning from others. The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems. Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative digital libraries. We can learn from their experiences. For example, The Alberta Library (TAL)",

TAL works collaboratively with its members to promote universal access to materials and resources in more than 250 public, post-secondary, special, government and regional libraries. Unlike ODL, TAL does not include elementary or secondary schools. However, the timeline and funding we are proposing for ODL is comparable to TAL\u2018s experience. TAL\u2019s business planning took several years. TAL\u2019s implementation plan was supported by 8 million dollars in provincially shared funding, spread over three years, later revised to 15 million dollars over 4 years. Not only is Alberta\u2019s population 30% of Ontario\u2019s, TAL does not include elementary or secondary schools as partners; it has 250 member libraries. ODL envisions universal access for all 10,000,000 Ontarians, with more than 5000 Ontario libraries as partners. Although ODL can learn from TAL\u2019s practices, the scope of planning and implementing ODL is much larger than TAL. The ODL will be a partnership-based organization providing seamless electronic information services and resources to the citizens of Ontario. It will use local libraries as the entry point for common resources The ODL will recognize the unique responsibilities and needs of public libraries, school libraries, college and university libraries and special libraries. The ODL envisions a digital network of information resources, allowing members to collaborate when there is mutual benefit and to support the common mandates of local libraries. The principles which will define and guide the ODL are: Equitable access for all Ontarians: We will bring consistent, high-quality electronic resources and services to 10 million Ontario citizens We will eliminate barriers to the access to information and create more consistent services for library clients. Shared decision-making and accountability: We will facilitate consensus among members regarding ODL\u2019s portfolio of electronic licenses and services We will balance the interests and realities of small and large as well as rich and poor communities and institutions. Shared governance structure: We will share decision-making in order to enable the people we serve. We will work based on an underlying assumption of trust and synergy. Shared funding: We will leverage provincial, institutional, and local dollars to realize economies of scale and put Ontario dollars to work for everyone . We will be willing to pool talents and dollars in order to provide common services that are truly greater than those that can be maintained by individual institutions.",

Result: The ODL is implemented and validated The second phase will be to implement the ODL based on the business plan. This phase recognizes that for ODL to be optimally successful libraries must transition to a new way of doing business and providing services. The transition must occur while libraries continue to provide existing services and respond to current challenges. This implementation phase will funded by a partnership of government, library stakeholders and other interested parties as a means to quickly jumpstart the ODL. The seed money requested will allow libraries to realign their budgets and services as the infrastructure and content of the ODL is created and secured. Some of the funding will be new money, although there is every indication that existing budgets and methods of operating may be modified as a result of recommendations . During this phase the polices, procedures, governance structures and accountability mechanisms of the ODL will be put in place. Pilot projects will be initiated, evaluated and expanded. Information resources will be identified, contracts for these resources will be negotiated and resources will be made deployed through the ODL. Regular evaluation during this phase will ensure the ODL is achieving its objectives and is accountable to its key communities.

The ongoing funding of the ODL will be based on a partnership model involving all the key participants (i.e. government, libraries, donors, public and private sectors). All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are expected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the ODL on Ontario\u2019s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants (university, colleges, public libraries and schools). The proposed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as the ODL matures a growing share of ODL funding will come from libraries and non-governmental sources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 \u2013 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions: 1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period 2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period 3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55% during the same period",

A $50M budget leverages the consortium buying power of the province\u2019s libraries to secure the best prices for information resources, the widest accessibility and the most favourable contracts. A budget of this nature will ensure a core digital collection of sufficient scope and coverage to address a substantial amount of the wide and diverse information and learning needs of the citizens of Ontario (an overview of the nature of the ODL digital collection is appended). The proposed ODL expenditures in 2006 represent an investment of $5.00 per citizen. It is important to recognize that every new dollar per citizen invested in the Ontario Digital Library has a double benefit: it supports a province-wide library of high quality information resources and it strengthens every local library in Ontario by allowing them to reinvest existing dollars in new resources that enhance local services. This multiplier means that for every dollar invested in ODL the return on investment is worth $2 of value for Ontario.",

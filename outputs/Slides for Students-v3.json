    "text": "The creative spark that motivated this book was the observation that powerpoint presentations sometimes fail to produce a positive impact on student learning. There seems to be a strange, somewhat curious disconnect between an amazing technology and a mediocre or poor student learning experience. Discussions with other college faculty reinforced the idea that powerpoint presentations often fall short of expectations in the classroom. The initial curiosity about this disconnection became a personal journey to learn more about presentation technology and how it was used\u2014or misused\u2014in the classroom. My overall conclusion is that powerpoint presentations are often used in ineffective ways. This is not entirely the fault of the technology. Rather, the main problem lies in how humans use the technology. If we want to unleash the full potential of powerpoint presentations, we must",

    "text": "do a better job of creating presentations that fit the educational needs of our students. My exploration of the use of powerpoint in education suggested a need for definitive guidelines that would inform educators about the best practices for its use. Many educators have written specific studies of powerpoint in the classroom, but clear-cut recommendations based on this evidence were missing. The present book addresses this need by synthesizing information across psychological research areas, such as sensation, cognition, and behavior. Other evidence comes from classroom-based studies conducted by educational professionals across a wide range of academic disciplines. A third body of evidence was the recommendations made by professional designers who aim to improve the quality of powerpoint presentations. The present book was synthesized from these widely varied sources into recommendations that should help education professionals connect with their students and get better learning outcomes from their powerpoint presentations. This book is not meant to be a software manual or a how- to guide for using a particular software application. Many such books are available for Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint or Apple\u2019s Keynote software applications. Instead, this book\u2019s emphasis is on the design of educational presentations. The ideas behind these design concepts focus on general principles of human learning rather than a specific technology, so these ideas should work well for any particular kind of presentation software. Another feature that sets this book apart is the emphasis on an evidenced-based, scientific approach. This evidence focus leads to a substantively different way of designing presentations, one that provides a true",

    "text": "educational benefit rather than emphasizing the construction of pretty slides. A small but important challenge in the writing of this book was how to handle the term \u201cPowerPoint.\u201d At first, it seemed best to avoid using this term because it represents a proprietary product that is trademarked by the Microsoft Corporation. On the other hand, my attempts to write about presentations without using the term \u201cPowerPoint\u201d resulted in awkward writing. The heart of the issue is that the term \u201cPowerPoint\u201d has taken on multiple meanings and, therefore, can be used in more than one manner. Hubert Knoblauch, a sociologist who studies PowerPoint as a cultural phenomenon, suggests an elegant way to delicately treat this ambiguous term (Knoblauch, 2012, p. 3). He uses \u201cPowerPoint\u201d (note the capitalization) to refer specifically to the Microsoft Office software application. This capitalization is appropriate given that Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint software is a proper noun. In contrast, the term \u201cpowerpoint\u201d (all lower case) is used to describe a modern presentation style that is characterized by some form of multimedia supplement to the speaker\u2019s voice. This broad use of the term can refer generically to many modern presentations, regardless of the technology that was used. This book will follow Knoblauch\u2019s suggested usage of these terms to make this important distinction between a specific software product (PowerPoint) and the more general uses of multimedia to support presentations (powerpoint). The writing of this book was a large and somewhat audacious project that was supported by many people. In particular, I thank Ellen Cotter, my wife, for her support of this project and her great proofreading skills. This book would not have been possible without her. From my department, I thank Jamie MacLennan for",

My colleagues also suggested numerous ideas that have been incorporated into this book. The Interlibrary Loan librarians at GSW were instrumental for obtaining the numerous articles that formed the basis of this book. Their support is greatly appreciated. I thank Stephen Snyder, Director of University Relations at GSW, for taking high-quality pictures of the powerpoint displays in the classroom. Finally, I would like to thank the University of North Georgia Press for believing in the vision of this book and the potential benefit that it might have for educational professionals.

    "text": "if there are any further questions. One student asks a question, which the professor answers. The class is dismissed. Now, consider your reaction to this scenario. It\u2019s likely that your initial response is that this imaginary class sounds a bit dull. This scenario fits our modern standards for education, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be dynamic or student-centered. It describes a rather passive approach to learning that places too much emphasis on the slide show. Somewhat mysteriously, the state of the art powerpoint technology has led to a mediocre educational experience. This humdrum result occurred even though the professor had good intentions and put a significant effort into giving the students a first-rate education. The above scenario, with some slight variations, is repeated in university and K12 educational settings numerous times each day all over the world. Of course, the exact number of educational presentations is not precisely known, but the number must be rather high. Microsoft once estimated that 300 million PowerPoint presentations of all kinds are given daily (I. Parker, 2001). Another estimate is that 350 powerpoint presentations are being given each second (Parks, 2012). These high numbers illustrate the importance of powerpoint presentations in modern culture. Slide presentations are found in business, education, government, and the sciences. Even churches have adopted this technology to assist worshippers during church services. The ubiquity of powerpoint presentations shows that powerpoint is taking a central role in everyday modern life (Knoblauch, 2012). The current cultural standard is that every presentation must include a slide show. For educators, the classroom experience often focuses on the slide deck (an antiquated term for a",

    "text": "The use of visual aids to supplement presentations emerged in the early part of the twentieth century as a movement towards making business management more scientific. An early example is from the Du Pont chemical company, which had a special \u201cchart room\u201d that was designed for business meetings (Yates, 1985). Large charts with financial information were moved in and out of the conference room on tracks to support the process of making business decisions. The use of visual displays for presentations was slowly adopted and imitated by other companies throughout the twentieth century. Early proponents of this visually-focused approach to presentations included scientists, engineers, and the military. By the 1960s, the practice of supplementing presentations with visual aids had become the presentation standard in many technical fields. Important technical innovations that fostered is practice are the introduction of the overhead projector in 1962 (3M, 2002) and the introduction of the microcomputer in the 1980s. Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint software, which is the industry standard for presentations, began as a commercial product called \u201cPresenter\u201d in 1987 (Gaskins, 2007). The initial purpose of the software was to facilitate the creation of transparencies (version 1.0) and 35-millimeter slides (version 2.0) for use in business presentations. In 1990, the software became a component of the Microsoft Office business software suite and was rebranded",

    "text": "\u201cPowerPoint.\u201d The distribution of PowerPoint software as a part of the Microsoft Office product suite helped PowerPoint to quickly become the standard presentation software in the field of business, which was then followed by its adoption in government, schools, and other institutions. The use of visual aids for supplementing a presentation is a twentieth century technology revolution in the way that presentations are given. In the 1800s, it would have been unusual to supplement a presentation with a visual aid. At most, educators used chalkboards to provide a visual supplement to their lectures (May, 1855; as cited in S. C. Parker, 1912, p. 92). In the 1960s through the 1980s, educators occasionally used transparencies on an overhead projector to supplement a lecture. Now, it is almost unthinkable to give a presentation without supporting visual materials. It would feel unnatural and wrong. In the past 100 years, our cultural standards for what constitutes a good presentation have changed from purely verbal speeches to presentations supplemented by multimedia visual aids. Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint software has enjoyed a near monopoly on presentation software for almost thirty years, which is an unusually long period of market dominance compared to other computer-based technologies. Just think of the technologies that were popular a decade or two ago\u2013film cameras, WordPerfect, My Space\u2013but have disappeared or been replaced by newer and better technology. Educational professionals are not immune to these rapid technology changes. Given this ever-changing technology environment, it seems appropriate to ask the question of whether or not powerpoint is still relevant in the contemporary classroom. Perhaps powerpoint technology is nearing the end of its lifespan.",

    "text": "So, is PowerPoint obsolete? If we focus on PowerPoint, the Microsoft product, then the answer might be \u201cmaybe,\u201d although obsolescence seems unlikely given the decades of market dominance that this product has enjoyed. A better question is to shift to a broader focus: Is powerpoint (the multimedia presentation form) obsolete? The answer to this question is a resounding \u201cno.\u201d Educators have been using visual aids to complement the teacher\u2019s voice since chalkboards became common classroom equipment in the 1800s. Furthermore, our current cultural standard has an expectation that a speaker\u2019s words will be accompanied by a visual event for the audience to watch. Multimedia presentations that supplement the speaker\u2019s voice with text and images clearly have much to offer for educators and students. Research efforts in this area are still making significant progress in understanding the best multimedia methods for teachers to use in their classrooms. Altogether, multimedia presentations are clearly valuable for teachers and students, and so powerpoint, the multimedia presentation style, will continue to be an important educational tool well into the future. The instructional recommendaations given in this book will not become quickly obsolete like last year\u2019s iPhone model. A strong effort has been made to avoid providing a simple \u201chow-to\u201d book for using Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint software application, although in some situations references will be made to specific PowerPoint features given that this software is widely used. In contrast, the overall aim of this book is to focus on the design of visual aids or multimedia presentations that are effective for education. The principles outlined in this book will help the reader to become proficient in assembling text and images in multimedia presentations in a manner that promotes student learning. These ideas should work regardless",

    "text": "Powerpoint technology clearly offers some strong advantages for presentations. Professional-looking graphics can be easily and quickly created, even by people who have limited experience with the software. The visual display of information makes text and graphics more accessible to the audience. For example, words projected on a powerpoint presentation are much more legible than hand-written words on a chalkboard. Presenters can also use graphics to support their main points in ways that were difficult to accomplish before the powerpoint revolution. Although the modern powerpoint presentation has some clear advantages, the very real downside that accompanies the use of presentation technology is apparent to anyone who has watched enough presentations. Powerpoint seems to be a double-edged sword. It can make good presentations better, but it also has the potential to make bad presentations become worse. Powerpoint presentations can sometimes be a tortured, unpleasant experience for the audience, an experience that is often called \u201cdeath by powerpoint\u201d and other unflattering terms. Our ability to use powerpoint\u2019s potential in ways that actually improve presentations lags behind the adoption of the technology. The technology has leaped forward, yet human communication skills do not differ much from what they have always been.",

The creators of these software applications have strived to make the software easy to use, so creating good slides for a presentation should be a snap. Unfortunately, the truth is that ease of use does not translate into effective presentations. In fact, some presentation experts have suggested that the software\u2019s ease of use has created a contradictory situation. Many educators may overestimate the quality of their presentations by confusing the ease of creation with the quality of the final product. The thoughtless and untrained application of default powerpoint settings may be an important part of the powerpoint paradox: amazing technology resulting in weak presentations.",

The class is largely a lecture format, although occasionally other educational strategies are used to promote critical thinking about controversial issues.

    "text": "student classroom experience, so it made sense to put a strong effort into developing a good slide deck to support her lectures. The development effort included making the presentations well- organized and full of the main key terms that were most likely to be on an exam. Most of the slides had a title and listed key terms with the corresponding definitions. Some of the slides came prepared from the textbook publisher. These prepared slides included vibrant colors and decorative graphics which seemed to be attractive and appealing to students. Dr. Nuprof believed that using the publisher\u2019s slides would be a smart choice because these slides are designed by professionals and are convenient to use. In particular, the convenience of a prepared slide deck was important to Dr. Nuprof because she felt overwhelmed by the need to develop content for her courses, several of which she had not taught before. Overall, she was pleased with her slides. Powerpoint presentations are expected in modern college classes and she had successfully met this expectation. Dr. Nuprof began the semester with high confidence in her teaching abilities and her pedagogical approach. Her classroom presentations went over the bullet points on the slides in a dutiful manner. At first, it seemed as if everything was going according to plan. Over the course of the semester though it became apparent that something wasn\u2019t working right. Her students showed signs of disengagement, such as day dreaming and phone-fiddling. The students seem to come alive for a moment when a new slide was introduced. This was followed by quickly copying down the text on the slide. After this, the students fell back into disengagement and apathy. The cycle would repeat when a new slide was introduced. It was a frustrating experience to work with such uninvolved students.",

    "text": "The overall picture was not great either, with student performance being low on exams and Dr. Nuprof receiving lukewarm feedback on her student evaluations. Attendance seemed weak, with some students opting to download the powerpoint file from the learning management system rather than attend class. It seemed that Dr. Nuprof had checked all of the right boxes for a good teaching approach, but something vital was still missing. Her classes were not terrible, but they also could not be considered a great success. Like every good teacher, Dr. Nuprof set out to improve upon her teaching practices for the next semester. She read expert advice about powerpoint presentations and did a thorough evaluation of the role of powerpoint in her courses. These ideas guided changes to boost the effectiveness of multimedia presentations in her courses. She began by throwing out the content-heavy PowerPoint slides that were provided by the textbook publisher. These were replaced with her own slide decks that had a story-like structure to the overall presentation (see Chapter 6). The useless colors and unnecessary decorations from the prepared slide decks were eliminated in order to focus student attention on the relevant ideas and information (see Chapter 11). The classroom time was changed to set aside time for active learning exercises as a break from pure lecturing (see Chapters 5, 10, and 12). Many slides that only contained bullet point information were replaced with the more effective assertion-evidence slide format that combines statements and supporting images (Chapter 9). Images with relevant educational content, such as pictures of important historical events, were used to increase student interest and deliver information more efficiently (see Chapters 5 and 9). The segments of pure lecturing were alternated with",

In some sections, she tried posing questions to students on slides, with a student response system (sometimes called \u201cclickers\u201d) for collecting student answers. This was a deliberate effort to employ a more active learning strategy (see Chapter 12). She addresses the low attendance problem by discussing note-taking strategies with the students, regarding how slide deck files were intended to provide an important resource for students\u2019 note-taking efforts instead of simply making class time unnecessary (see Chapter 13). In one section, she stopped posting the powerpoint slides to the learning management system, so the easily available slides could not contribute to the low attendance problem. Dr. Nuprof\u2019s students responded positively to these changes. The degree of student involvement throughout the class period seemed better. The students felt that the class was more challenging that simply copying down text from a slide, but this challenge was positive and welcomed by the students. The class was now more interesting and thought-provoking to the students. More students were asking questions, which improved the interactions between teacher and student. Class time had been changed from a one-way transfer of information to a two-way dialog between the students and the professor. As a result, Dr. Nuprof\u2019s classroom experience was transformed from a dull slog through a mountain of educational content towards a more rewarding give-and-take intellectual exchange, for both the students and Dr. Nuprof. For the semester, the grades were up slightly and Dr. Nuprof\u2019s student evaluations also improved.",

    "text": "Looking back, Dr. Nuprof realized that an effective powerpoint presentation requires much more than simply filling out the bullets on a slide with some key terms or providing commentary on a slide deck provided by the textbook publisher. Her previous approach treated powerpoint like it was an electronic chalk board for showing words to students. The heavy emphasis on key terms and definitions was not engaging and did little to promote significant learning processes. She realized that this information- focused approach is too shallow. Effective instruction is more than feeding information to students on pretty slides. The real goal is to consider the larger educational strategy and purpose of each topic, then thoughtfully design the presentation and class activities in ways that promote student learning. This approach needs to consider the student as a whole person: emotions, perception, attention, cognition, and behavior. All of these dimensions must come together in a deliberate manner to make a presentation a meaningful learning tool. This fictitious example is, admittedly, rather optimistic. The important point though is that powerpoint presentations can be much more than a lifeless information delivery machine. Bullet point lists are a starting point, but lists are not really sufficient to fully engage student learning. Ideally, the right pedagogical design and approach in powerpoint could help both the instructors and the students achieve the mission of better learning through balancing information delivery, student engagement, and questions that foster deeper forms of learning. There is much potential in powerpoint that currently goes unrealized or escapes critical examination. The right application is all that\u2019s needed to unlock it.",

Most educators have significant familiarity with Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint or a similar program like Apple\u2019s Keynote. The average educator regularly makes basic presentations based upon powerpoint templates, such as slides with bullet point list designs and built- in color schemes. Unfortunately, the presentation design skills of most educators probably do not progress much beyond the most basic levels of powerpoint use. Most teachers have not received significant-enough advanced training that would enable them to do more than make a basic presentation. Consequently, most educators can make a decent basic powerpoint presentation, but probably not one that truly stimulates significant student learning. Simply replacing the chalkboard with a colorful slide is not going to accomplish much for helping students learn. A need exists for thoughtfully designed and implemented classroom instruction that focuses on the learner rather than on the technology. Fortunately, over 400 published articles in professional journals examine questions concerning how powerpoint could work for improving education. These articles span a wide range of academic disciplines, such as education, business, psychology, and nursing. Most of these studies are based on empirical evidence, such as student surveys, teacher experiences, and experimental studies. Some laboratory-based studies have also been done by psychologists, typically ones who specialize in education or cognition. In total, the information",

The present book was written to translate academic research findings into practical suggestions about powerpoint that educators can use. The higher aim of making powerpoint into a better educational tool is somewhat elusive, yet this effort is a worthwhile investment. While involving a greater degree of effort than simply filling out the next bullet point, carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages of modern presentation software will hopefully lead to effective presentations that avoid the dreaded \u201cdeath by powerpoint\u201d experience.

    "text": "An important concern is that presenters must greatly simplify their technical information in order to fit it into the limitations of powerpoint. This problem stems from the practical constraints imposed by the slide medium. The size of the text used in a presentation must be large in order to make that text visible to the audience. The unavoidable consequence of large type is that only a few words can be placed on a slide. In addition, colorful graphics, corporate logos, and/or special layouts often take up valuable slide space, thus further decreasing the space available for the presenter\u2019s information. These limitations encourage the use of short phrases over complete sentences, leading to Tufte\u2019s comment about \u201cforeshortening\u201d of thought. Any supporting graphics, such as graphs and diagrams, must also be very simple and direct, causing a loss of their complexity and details. Altogether, Tufte\u2019s view is that the limitations of powerpoint require presenters to greatly reduce the complexity of their information in order to make the message fit on a slide. This reduction culminates in a dumbing- down of the content for the audience. Only the highlights can be covered in a powerpoint presentation, which necessitates leaving out details that might be important. Comparing the limitations of powerpoint to printed formats, Tufte finds the latter as being able to carry a much higher information density. Tufte is certainly correct that less information can be placed on a slide than on a printed document. However, the counterpoint to Tufte\u2019s critique is that we should not expect presentations to convey the same degree of information as the printed word",

    "text": "(Doumont, 2005). Too many details in a presentation will simply overwhelm an audience. When used correctly, the limitations of a powerpoint slide can be an asset by forcing the presenter to focus on only the most important information. Unimportant details should be deliberately excluded from the presentation in order to avoid distractions or overloading the audience. By limiting the information, the presenter quite literally points the main ideas out to the audience by directing their attention to the main message. The unavoidable drawback of these limits is that details might become lost or overlooked, although this may not always be a significant problem. Fortunately, teachers and college professors have more ways of delivering content to their students than a mere powerpoint slide deck. The information presented during a class period is, to some degree, an introduction to the topic. Instructors typically supplement the information from a slide deck with information from other sources such as textbook content, supplemental readings, demonstrations, videos, and assignments. Thus, the classroom presentation can concentrate on the highly important information and the other sources can fill in the details.",

    "text": "The instructor then follows this predetermined order, usually without deviations, during the presentation. The prepared slide deck ultimately controls their flow, thereby making instructors become excessively rigid and lacking in spontaneity. In education, several critics have voiced concerns that slide presentations may encourage teachers to march through the course content with little interaction from the students (Frommer, 2012; Kjeldsen, 2006; Klemm, 2007). Teachable moments that might come from student questions can be lost if these questions go into directions that deviate from the order of the slide deck. A related problem is that the rigid structure may create a classroom environment that encourages the audience to be obediently quiet and listen instead of interrupting the presentation\u2019s predestined flow. This may promote an authoritarian relationship between teachers and students. A third possible problem is that powerpoint\u2019s strictly linear organization might suggest a simple linear relationship between topics (A then B then C) when, in reality, the true relationships between topics might be much more complicated (Kinchin, Chadha, and Kokotailo, 2008). The emphasis on serial order could lead to an erroneous or oversimplified understanding of how the various components of a topic relate to each other. The possibility that the structure of powerpoint presentations stifles student participation may be a common view, but it might not have much research support. Knoblauch (2012) and colleagues conducted studies of live powerpoint presentations and carefully analyzed the social interactions. His conclusion is that \u201c. . . audiences are not passive recipients of presentations but are actively oriented to both the technology as well as the presenter\u202f.\u202f.\u202f.\u201d (p. 126).",

    "text": "Knoblauch observed that professional powerpoint presentations are a communication genre that specifically encourages audience interactions at predetermined points in a professional presentation, such as question and answer periods at the end of a presentation. He also found that audience participation was facilitated because both the presenter and audience can refer to the text or graphics shown on the slides when discussing the topic. The slide presentation can become a common point of interaction for the audience and the presenter, and this makes the presence of powerpoint visual aids actually increase audience participation. Knoblauch concludes his analysis by stating, \u201cIn summary, we can quite clearly see that powerpoint does not obstruct interaction between audience and presenter\u201d (p. 133). This rigidity problem, if it truly is an issue, can be addressed by an adept teacher. Knoblauch\u2019s analysis suggests that the social structure of the classroom, and not technology, drives student- teacher interactions. A class meeting period does not necessarily need to be a continuous powerpoint presentation from start to finish. Teachers can build specific periods or activities into their class time that encourage student-teacher interactions. The slide deck organization might be a helpful skeleton for organizing classroom activities, but it does not need to be the dominant force for determining social interactions.",

    "text": "important information to the audience. At their worst, decorative features may be deliberately used by some presenters to give the illusion of a meaningful presentation. For example, the military sometimes gives powerpoint presentations to news reporters with the intent of not revealing very much information, a practice derisively called \u201chypnotizing chickens\u201d (Bumiller, 2010). The use of unnecessary special effects in powerpoint presentations has decreased somewhat since Tufte voiced his concerns. Much of Tufte\u2019s criticism over content-free presentations was centered upon a Microsoft PowerPoint feature called the AutoContent Wizard. This feature automated the development of presentations to some degree by suggesting formats for presenters to build their presentations upon. The AutoContent Wizard was heavily criticized (I. Parker, 2001; van Jole, 2000) and was not very popular with users (Knoblauch, 2012), so in 2007 Microsoft discontinued the AutoContent Wizard. Current users of PowerPoint consequently need to take a stronger hand in developing their own presentation content. Doing so may satisfy the \u201ccontent-free\u201d criticism that Tufte once aimed at PowerPoint software. Another positive development for presentation content is that current expectations for presentations are shifting away from the use of unnecessary flashy features. For example, early guides on using Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint often suggested using built-in clip art of mostly decorative images that was supplied with the software. The best known clip art example was the group of \u201cscreen beans\u201d characters: faceless stick figures portrayed in a range of business settings. In contrast, presentation experts currently encourage users to deliberately avoid the use of generic clip art and built-in themes to achieve a more professional-looking presentation.",

However, this criticism may be somewhat misplaced. Content is important, of course, but an effective presentation cannot be entirely content. To a significant degree, presentations are also about conveying emotion to an audience by, for example, displaying the presenter\u2019s enthusiasm for the topic (Duarte, 2010). A presentation that lacks an emotional connection with the audience will come across as being dry and overly abstract. The presenter is confronted with a choice between emphasizing content, which might seem dull, versus emphasizing emotionally-grabbing visual displays that could lack useful information. Thus, the counterpoint to Tufte\u2019s concern about an overemphasis on style is that the emotional qualities of a presentation are an important part of a successful presentation.",

    "text": "fields of business and the military also feel that powerpoint has weakened decision-making processes by encouraging presenters to omit important details (Bumiller, 2010; Hammes, 2009; Shaw, Brown, and Bromiley, 1998) A number of educators have also raised alarms about the potentially-damaging effects of powerpoint on student learning (Creed, 1997; Hlynka and Mason, 1998; Kjeldsen, 2006; Klemm, 2007; Mason and Hlynka, 1998). A common criticism is that powerpoint is a teacher-centered technology rather than a student-centered learning experience. It has been suggested that powerpoint encourages teachers to give boring lectures that deliver information without fostering much critical thinking. In other words, powerpoint technology promotes the view of teaching as a passive transfer of information from teacher to student. It might not be the instructor\u2019s intent to lecture in this fashion, but slide technology might encourage this kind of teaching anyway. This problem might be a particularly significant issue for difficult topics that students tend to struggle with. It might be easier for the instructor to muscle through a difficult class period by marching through the slides rather than attempting to engage students in the complexities of a difficult topic. New technology in education is often met with both enthusiasm and negative reactions. Educational critics often raise concerns about technology causing a decline in cognitive abilities. In the 1960s, many educators viewed television as an instructional medium that would revolutionize education, but others saw television as a \u201cvast wasteland\u201d(Minow, 1961). In the 1970s, math educators debated the use of calculators in math instruction (Ellington, 2003).  The concern was that student overreliance on",

    "text": "calculators would lead to a weakening of basic math skills. Studies of calculator usage have since found no detrimental effect on basic math skills  (for a review, see Ellington, 2003). Most recently, critics have suggested that modern technologies, such as text messaging, Twitter, and web searches, are degrading our mental skills (Carr, 2010; M. Jackson, 2008). The concern is that people are replacing the sustained concentration of serious reading and critical analysis with a blizzard of small information snippets, and that these many small fragments of information are ultimately detrimental to focused attention and serious critical thought. Even the general concern about cognitive damage is frequently expressed in sound-bite form: \u201cIs Google making us stupid?\u201d (Carr, 2008). Altogether, the concern about how powerpoint might negatively impact our cognitive abilities can be viewed in a cultural context of a vague uneasiness and apprehension of new technology. Innovations produce new ways of working and thinking that may feel unfamiliar and, therefore, are treated with some suspicion. Many powerpoint critiques express this feeling of vague apprehension. The critics aren\u2019t sure exactly what the negative effects of slide presentations might be, but they are convinced that these effects must be harmful somehow. Our approach to such negative views of new technology should be cautious. Valid criticisms must be examined, but we must also be careful to avoid being technology Luddites. Technology certainly can change the way that we think, possibly for the worse. Modern technology has an equally great ability to enhance and improve cognition in new ways.",

    "text": "Some educational observers have raised the possibility that powerpoint could have unintended, insidious effects that might not be immediately obvious to the teacher. Marshall McLuhan, a media studies expert, famously used the phrase \u201cThe medium is the message\u201d to express the idea that media can carry an indirect social message to the audience (McLuhan, 1964) . In brief, McLuhan\u2019s argument is that every medium has an overt message that is accompanied by a more covert message about how people in the audience are supposed to act, think, or feel. This covert message might influence people in subtle ways. For example, perhaps slide presentations implicitly suggest a particular social relationship between the teacher and the student. The teacher is the expert authority whose word must not be questioned (at least not too much). The students, in contrast, are the followers who must assume a passive role, possibly without much awareness of this role. Curiously, the subtle communication effects about standards and social conventions may also influence teachers as much as students. Concerns about these subtle media effects have led some commentators to suggest that powerpoint and other technologies can \u201cedit our thoughts\u201d (I. Parker, 2001; Turkle, 2004). This use of the term \u201cedit\u201d does not mean a literal change in our brain. Rather, the idea is that powerpoint standards that shape the basic features of a presentation may also have unintentional influences on the way that we present information to students (C. Adams, 2006; Stoner, 2007). The software guides teachers in subtle ways to encourage certain presentation styles, such as lecturing and the",

Over time, the use of presentation templates and other software guidance may even influence the thinking and the teaching approach of the educator. These implicit nudges effects that guide powerpoint presentations might also influence student expectations and behaviors. Cognitive psychologists use the term \u201cfunctional fixedness\u201d to describe situations in which our past experience with using a tool may prevent or inhibit the tool user from thinking of new and creative uses for that object. Like blinders on a horse, the conventional use of a tool limits the possibilities we can conceive, so tool use can inhibit creativity. The powerpoint version of functional fixedness is the ubiquity of slides that follow default formats. Older versions of Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint application started with a default blank slide that consisted of a heading\u2014 \u201cClick to add title\u201d\u2014and a similar field for bullet points. For another example, Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint give design suggestions when photos are inserted into a slide. Older versions of PowerPoint software kept images in a preformatted box, whereas the latest software versions give design suggestions that are less restricted. These defaults and guided activities form an \u201cinvitation\u201d to make slides in a conventional manner ( e.g., a title and bullet point lists; C. Adams, 2006). These features may help new software users get started as simply as possible, but it may, in the long run, send a subtle message that the best slide for a presentation should follow the bullet-point list layout (C. Adams, 2006). Once new users begin making slides with titles and three bullet points, the use of the default format gradually becomes a habit that influences how all presentations are made. In time, this habit influences the presenter\u2019s thinking by encouraging the view that all topics and",

    "text": "by weak presenters into dynamic talks given by charismatic rock stars. In this sense, much of the criticism about powerpoint seems misdirected. The root cause of many of bad presentations is simple: Most people dread giving presentations and do not give presentations on a routine basis. In addition, most presenters have received little training in either the use of powerpoint or the art of giving presentations. These inexperienced presenters tend to lean heavily upon powerpoint technology as if it were a crutch or handrail to get through the difficult and unpleasant task of giving a presentation. Considering these circumstances, we should not be surprised when the occasional presentation by these presenters is dull and uninteresting. In brief, the real problem with many modern presentations is often a simple lack of communication skills (Doumont, 2005; Shwom and Keller, 2003). It\u2019s a human failure rather than a technology failure. We therefore must be somewhat wary of critics who blame the technology rather than more accurately faulting the presenter who created the presentation. Contrary to the critics, it can be argued that powerpoint is a great asset for people who struggle with presentations. The software imposes a structure on the presenter\u2019s message that could help the presenter organize their thoughts. The slides also give the audience something to look at during the presentation, thereby giving the audience a more valuable experience than they might have received from a strictly verbal presentation. The overall result is that a bad presentation with slides could in some situations be better than a bad presentation without slides. Slide-based presentations do not need to be a totalitarian or lifeless teaching endeavor. Furthermore, slide presentations are",

Some teachers had concerns about negative effects like intellectual \u201cnarrowing\u201d and the PowerPoint AutoContent Wizard. In contrast, other teachers thought that PowerPoint might have positive educational benefits. Although some of powerpoint\u2019s critics have been quite vocal, their criticism is often based on thin evidence. Even Tufte, the information literacy expert, does not provide much evidence to back up his assertion that powerpoint is \u201cevil.\u201d Tufte\u2019s strongest evidence was a case study of how powerpoint may have led to poor engineering decisions that eventually contributed to the destruction of the space shuttle Columbia and the death of several astronauts. Tufte\u2019s view is that the disastrous shuttle decision occurred because important safety information was omitted from a powerpoint presentation. Important safety details would not have been missed in a more thorough written report. His other quantitative evidence is based upon a review of charts from twenty-eight books and publications. This analysis concluded that, compared to printed sources, powerpoint statistical graphics are \u201cthe thinnest of all\u201d in regards to the information provided to the audience (Tufte, 2006, p. 5). Ironically, it has been argued that Tufte\u2019s evidence against powerpoint is itself rather thin (Doumont, 2005). Because there have been numerous scientific studies of powerpoint and how it influences learning in the classroom, it is possible to take an evidence-based view of powerpoint and its potential usefulness in teaching environments. We will carefully examine the evidence from these scientific studies to determine if powerpoint presentations are helpful or harmful to student learning.

Their motivating idea was the possibility that powerpoint presentations might be more engaging than chalkboards or overhead transparencies, and thereby have greater educational value. The general view was that the colors, styles, layouts, and animations in a typical powerpoint presentation would be more likely to engage student attention and emotions compared to older forms of instructional technology. This increased engagement would translate into better information retention and more learning. This idea has been described as an arousal view of educational media (Levasseur and Sawyer, 2006). In other words, powerpoint presentation effects would breathe some emotional life into otherwise dry academic topics and thereby improve learning through increasing student interest. Older technologies, in contrast, were viewed as being less dynamic or less interesting to the students, and would therefore have less impact on student learning.

Educational psychologists use the term \u201cmedia comparison studies\u201d to address the question of how well students learn from different types of media. This research typically examines whether students would learn better from a more advanced, newer educational medium (such as powerpoint) compared to a less advanced, older medium (such as chalkboards) The research design of these effectiveness studies often divides students into two groups, with one group (experimental) receiving powerpoint- based instruction and the second group (control) receiving some other form of instruction. This alternate instruction may take the form of visual aids via the chalkboard or overhead projector, but in some studies, the control group had no visual aids at all during their lectures. At the end of the study, the experimental (powerpoint) and control (no powerpoint) groups are compared on a student achievement measure, such as test grades. The anticipated outcome is that students who received instruction via powerpoint presentations will learn more than students who did not, presumably due to the greater engagement, attention, and sensory arousal provided by the powerpoint presentations. Although the basic media comparison study is straightforward, it is somewhat challenging to summarize the overall findings from these studies due to a wide range of minor variations in how the studies were conducted. The various studies sometimes used different software (e.g., Aldus Persuasion), student age groups, and control groups. In some studies, the powerpoint content was nearly the same as an overhead transparency, but in other studies",

    "text": "the powerpoint presentations included video clips and animations, which made the powerpoint presentation a much stronger multimedia experience. In other studies, the participants were given both powerpoint presentations and handouts to accompany the lectures. Despite these differences, the common factor is that these studies attempted to compare powerpoint-based classroom presentations to other forms of instructional technology (or no technology). This key comparison forms the basis for determining the potential for enhanced teaching with powerpoint. Since the early 1990s, at least fifty-eight media comparison studies on powerpoint have been conducted (see Appendix A), with some publications reporting multiple studies (e.g., Szabo and Hastings, 2000, provides three studies). Most of these studies were identified through searches of academic databases (Google Scholar, EBSCO, ProQuest) for articles published by the end of 2016. Two comprehensive review articles published in 2006 were also useful for identifying early publications (Levasseur and Sawyer, 2006; E. J. Shapiro et al., 2006). The references of the articles identified through these search methods were further scrutinized for additional papers that might have escaped the keyword search process. A strong effort was made to be as comprehensive as possible, but it is important to acknowledge that the round-up of studies was challenging because the scholarship of teaching and learning on powerpoint is spread across a wide range of academic disciplines. The first criterion for inclusion was the use of PowerPoint or PowerPoint-like multimedia technology to deliver the educational content during class time. A second criterion was that the studies needed to have an experimental design or a quasi- experimental design (most common) that compared students",

    "text": "who received powerpoint-based instruction to a group that was not exposed to powerpoint. These comparison groups received a different form of supplemental media (usually chalkboards or transparencies) or possibly no supplemental media at all (lectures without any form of supporting technology). This effectiveness review did not include studies with nonexperimental designs, such as studies based upon correlational analyses or survey methods. The general finding from these media comparison studies is consistent: Students who receive powerpoint-based instruction do about the same on student achievement outcomes as students who receive traditional, lower-tech forms of instruction (see Appendix A). Most of the media comparison studies (65.5%; n = 38) produced no evidence for improvements in student learning when the students were taught with powerpoint visual aids. Somewhat surprisingly, improved learning outcomes only occurred in 20.7% (n = 12) of the studies. The overall evidence from this research suggests that powerpoint instruction yields no educational benefit in most situations or maybe a slight benefit in some situations. This conclusion is supported by two comprehensive review studies, one of which found no overall evidence of increased teaching effectiveness (Levasseur and Sawyer, 2006) and the other finding only a slight improvement with powerpoint (E. J. Shapiro et al., 2006). The conclusion that powerpoint lacks strong educational benefits is rather disappointing. It seems that a lot of work, energy, and money went into developing powerpoint presentations, yet this was largely a wasted effort because student learning did not improve. In spite of this seeming failure, these findings still provide some useful evidence for educators. Recall that the",

    "text": "key idea behind these studies was the arousal viewpoint that the presence of color and other dramatic powerpoint features would capture student attention and emotions, and the increased engagement from these effects would enhance learning. The evidence, however, shows that the arousal theory is a failure. The anticipated engagement benefit of a powerpoint presentation actually produces little-to-no difference in educational outcomes. This outcome is important to keep in mind for educators who design their own powerpoint presentations. Powerpoint features that are meant to grab attention or arouse emotion may not necessarily have any benefit for learning. Teachers may intuitively feel that dramatic powerpoint presentation features like vivid colors would increase learning, but the evidence clearly doesn\u2019t support this view. It could also be argued from this evidence that powerpoint technology is not absolutely necessary to achieve meaningful student learning and engagement. On a positive note, the effectiveness studies show that powerpoint does not seem to be hurting students. Only a few media comparison studies (13.8%, n = 8; Appendix A) find detrimental effects from powerpoint-based instruction. From this, we can conclude that the powerpoint \u201cinvasion\u201d into the classroom does not seem to harm student learning. The grave concerns about cognitive damage raised by powerpoint critics (see Chapter 2) seem to be unfounded. The results from these studies clearly indicate that powerpoint use does not produce superior learning outcomes when compared to older forms of teaching technology. Let\u2019s try to dig a bit deeper into these results. Given the potential for powerpoint to capture students\u2019 attention and present information in an organized and",

    "text": "compelling way, why have so many studies failed to show that powerpoint has consistent, positive effects on student learning? This is a perplexing question for many education researchers. In retrospect, there are several reasons why media studies that compare powerpoint-based lectures to more traditional approaches have not established the educational superiority of powerpoint. One common problem is that many of these studies have weak research designs that limit the researchers\u2019 ability to make strong conclusions. The practical limitations of classroom settings make it difficult or even impossible to randomly assign students to the experimental and the control group, thereby limiting researchers to quasi-experimental or correlational research designs that can make it difficult to establish unambiguous conclusions. Another research weakness in education is that the outcomes, like exam scores, might be insensitive. It is a challenge to increase the exam score average for an entire class by even a small amount. This insensitivity might make it difficult to measure small improvements in learning that might be attributed to powerpoint presentations. The details of how the experimental and control conditions differed in educational content may be another possible reason for the failure to find improvements in powerpoint-based instruction. Most of these studies compared powerpoint-based class presentations to other classes that received the same instructional content delivered by chalkboards or overhead transparencies. Using identical content in both conditions was done to control for extraneous variables that might interfere with interpreting the outcome of the experiment. In retrospect, it seems likely that this effort to make the groups equal in regard to educational content made the experimental and control conditions so similar to each",

    "text": "other that any potential benefits from the powerpoint presentations were completely eliminated. A related problem is that many studies do not fully describe how powerpoint was used to present information in the experimental condition. It is often unspecified whether the instructors merely used bullet point lists, or also included supporting graphics or multimedia such as animations and videos. This lack of information about the educational content of the powerpoint slides raises the possibility that maybe the content examined was simply ineffective regardless of medium. These questions about educational content raise a sobering possibility: Perhaps many instructors simply copied lecture material from the chalkboard and the overhead projector into the newer powerpoint medium. Recreating a possibly-ineffective lecture format into a new instructional medium is not very likely to have a positive impact on learning. Despite its potential for engaging the audience, powerpoint instruction still favors a passive, lecture-style teaching approach, and this might explain why it often produces no measurable improvement in student learning outcomes. These studies emphasize the comparison of lecture-based instruction done with or without powerpoint technology. This emphasis reflects the goal of media comparison studies, which is to see if one media is superior to another for instructional purposes. This comparison effort was fueled by the passion for new technology in the field of education over the last 20 years, but it\u2019s arguable that placing so much emphasis on comparing various instructional technologies is misguided.

The preceding interpretations of why powerpoint doesn\u2019t dramatically improve student learning are somewhat minor research details. Educational experts who specialize in technology and learning have raised another possibility that goes deeper into the heart of effective instruction. Maybe technology like powerpoint simply doesn\u2019t change the fundamental nature of learning very much, so ultimately, the technology is not very important. The pedagogy, in contrast, is the real driver of student learning. This is the somewhat controversial conclusion of some media comparison studies skeptics. Richard Clark performed a broad review of various technologies used for education in an effort to assess their educational effectiveness (R. E. Clark, 1983, 1991). His main conclusion was that many instructional technologies that were originally thought to be revolutionary\u2014 radio, television, personal computers, and the Internet\u2014seemed, in retrospect, to produce no measurable improvement in student learning. In Clark\u2019s view, the teaching method (such as lecturing, collaborative groups, and discussions) is responsible for real changes in student learning, not the technology. It should be noted that while Clark\u2019s opinion was written before powerpoint became available in classrooms, he seems to have accurately anticipated the outcomes of the powerpoint effectiveness studies based on his examinations of previous technological advances. A clear bottom- line conclusion from the efficacy studies is that powerpoint does not provide a significant improvement in learning gains beyond older technologies like the blackboard and the overhead projector.

    "text": "The second general approach for evaluating the effectiveness of powerpoint-based instruction focuses upon student perceptions of powerpoint. Modern students receive many hours of powerpoint- supported lectures throughout their educational career. This direct experience makes student feedback valuable for understanding what works or doesn\u2019t work about powerpoint presentations. These student perception studies are relatively easy to perform and have been conducted in a wide range of settings and academic disciplines. The typical student perception study begins with students who are exposed to slide-based presentations during the semester. Sometimes, exposure to powerpoint-based lecture materials is alternated over the semester with traditional media such as chalkboards and overhead projectors. The students are surveyed at the end of the course to measure their impressions about powerpoint-based instruction. The students in these surveys compare their powerpoint experience to other instructional media, which they may have experienced in other classes. The students rate their perceptions of powerpoint-based instruction from \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d to \u201cStrongly agree\u201d on a numeric scale. Survey questions rated higher than neutral show a preference for the use of powerpoint. Many survey studies also include open-ended questions to collect more information from the respondents.",

    "text": "At least eighty-two published studies use surveys to ask students about their perceptions of powerpoint-based instruction (Appendix B). These studies were identified through a process that was similar to the review of the experimental studies: Keyword searches on databases followed by the identification of additional studies from careful evaluation of references in published papers. These papers were published in 2016 or earlier, with the earliest studies being in the mid-1990s. The inclusion criterion was the use of nonexperimental survey methods of student attitudes that asked students to report their feelings and thoughts about powerpoint- based instruction. These surveys varied in their questions, but all of them asked students about their general satisfaction level with the use of powerpoint for instructional purposes. The results from each study were broadly classified as evidence for positive, neutral, or negative attitudes towards powerpoint based on the majority of survey responses. Most surveys also had questions about other features, like the advantages and disadvantages of powerpoint. A qualitative analysis was performed to catalog the common student likes and dislikes about specific features. This analysis involved some degree of subjective interpretation given the variability of survey questions across these studies. The key finding: Students clearly like powerpoint. Students have an overall positive attitude towards powerpoint presentations in the majority of student attitude studies, 76.8% (n = 63). The typ- ical finding in these studies is that about 60% to 90% of the sur- veyed students indicate a preference for powerpoint-based lecture materials over chalkboards, transparencies, or no visual aids. In contrast, fewer studies report an overall neutral/mixed (13.4%; n = 11) or negative (9.8%; n = 8) student attitudes towards powerpoint.",

We can gain a clear view of students\u2019 experiences with powerpoint instruction through self-reports. This is very important because we want students to have a positive experience in the classroom. However, self-reported views tend to be highly subjective opinions. The general finding that students like powerpoint doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that this kind of instruction is effective, engaging, or stimulating deep thoughts. There is a disturbing possibility that students might like powerpoint for the wrong reasons, such as using powerpoint to put less effort into their coursework. The finding that students like powerpoint is certainly encouraging, but it is not sufficient, by itself, to establish that powerpoint is a worthwhile technology for the classroom. What are the specific features of powerpoint that students like? There is a wide range of reasons, many of which are pragmatic in nature. The following lists summarize what students like and dislike about powerpoint-based classroom presentations. These conclusions are listed in the order of preference from the most frequently occurring to the least frequent. For brevity, specific citations for each finding have been omitted.",

Note-taking may also be aided when instructors provide a printed handout or a digital powerpoint file before class. 5. Instructor Qualities : Students have favorable impressions of instructors who use powerpoint. These favorable ratings include being more organized, better prepared for class, more credible, and more professional compared to teachers who do not use powerpoint. Students are also more likely to indicate on course evaluations that they would take another class from a professor who uses powerpoint. 6. Exam Preparation : Students like reviewing powerpoint files or handouts provided by the instructor as they prepare for exams. 7. Efficiency : Students feel that powerpoint can be used to cover more information during a class period. 8. Visual Aids : Students approve of using visual aids, such as graphs and figures, to support learning. 9.

    "text": "There are a few other positive characteristics. Some students prefer the combined use of auditory (spoken) and visual (powerpoint) information. Student who miss class presentations appreciate having the powerpoint slides available online so they can access the material that was missed, though not all instructors engage in this practice. Some students feel that powerpoint helps to promote class discussions. Finally, powerpoint may facilitate the proper spelling of technical terms, which is particularly important for students who have learned English as a second language. Overall, these benefits show that students have numerous reasons, most of them practical in nature, for preferring powerpoint presentations over traditional instructional media. Even though powerpoint may not significantly raise student grades, many students believe that it is still a worthwhile technology for supporting instruction. These strong student preferences provide a compelling reason for instructors to use powerpoint, particularly if there is no strong evidence that doing so is detrimental to student learning. We must note that the results from student perception studies can be a bit misleading when students are asked to assess their own learning and memory. A few studies have directly compared student perceptions of their own learning to their actual learning performance. These studies show that students\u2019 belief that powerpoint improves learning is not necessarily accompanied by an improvement in exam scores (Apperson, Laws, and Scepansky,",

The student view that more is learned with powerpoint instruction is likely to be an overly optimistic opinion. The student survey research also provides a valuable source of information about what students dislike about powerpoint presentations.

This problem is not necessarily due to technology, however, because traditional lectures without powerpoint also have a reputation for being boring. This finding is consistent with the earlier speculation that technology alone cannot rescue a boring presentation. 4. Technical Problems : Technical difficulties can lead to dead moments in the classroom when the instructor must focus on fixing technology breakdowns instead of on teaching. It\u2019s understandable that students dislike these awkward technical failures that waste valuable class time. 5. Distraction and Note-taking : Some students report difficulty in simultaneously using the visual information from powerpoint along with the auditory information spoken by the teacher. Students may wonder which is more important, the verbal information from the teacher or the visual information from the slide? 6. Using Powerpoint as a Teleprompter : A common complaint, in both professional settings and education, is that the presenter simply reads the contents of the slide to the audience. The most obvious solution is that the presenter should not read from the slides word-for-word. However, doing so could create the problem mentioned in problem number 5 above.

The finding that too much or too little information are both problems shows how it can be difficult to find the optimal amount of information in a presentation. 8. Attendance Problems : Most students report that they would attend class even if the powerpoint file is available to them online in a course management system. However, some students may be more likely to skip class if they can easily obtain the slide deck without attending class, although this group represents a minority of respondents. 9. Visibility Problems : Powerpoint presentations have better visibility, in general, than traditional teaching media, but visibility problems can still occur. Students sometimes report difficulty in viewing poorly-constructed slides that are made with small font sizes or odd color choices. Darkened rooms may make the projected images on the screen more prominent, but the darkness also has the downside of making it more difficult for students to take notes or follow along in a textbook. Dark rooms may also make students sleepy. In contrast, using white or lightly colored backgrounds on the screen may sometimes make students seated in the front row feel that the presentation was blinding.",

In particular, teachers should give emphasis to how students feel about powerpoint, which is largely positive and could, in turn, produce more positive student expectations and attitudes toward learning. Students also view teachers who use powerpoint as being more organized and credible. For all of these reasons, contemporary students have come to expect that their instructors will use powerpoint (M. J. Jackson et al., 2011). Teachers who do not use powerpoint may receive student demands to begin using powerpoint (Driessnack, 2005) and may suffer from lower student evaluations (Hill et al., 2012; Koeber, 2005;  Schrodt and Witt, 2006; however, see also Daniels et al., 2008; Kunkel, 2004; Lowerison et al., 2006). Instructors who are ambivalent about using powerpoint should consider the students\u2019 enthusiastic viewpoint when deciding whether or not to use powerpoint technology. The lack of evidence for powerpoint instructional effectiveness is perhaps a sign that the standard practices for using powerpoint are not working very well. Many of the common powerpoint uses seem like dry lectures that merely attempt to pass information along to students. As noted above, transferring lecture materials from chalkboards to a newer medium like powerpoint is unlikely to overcome the inherent dullness of passive learning approaches. The teaching strategies instructors employ most often in powerpoint presentations likely are simply ineffective. Using powerpoint well involves more than simply filling out a few bullet points on a slide. Rather than despairing about this situation, we should view it as a challenge.

The statement \u201cThe speaker read slides to us\u201d was rated the most annoying presentation problem in 2017, with 67.8% of the respondents agreeing with this statement (Paradi, 2017). This issue has been the number one problem in Paradi\u2019s survey for many years. The problem is that the presenter is basically using the powerpoint presentation like a teleprompter, reading the entire speech from the slides to the audience. Reactions to this kind of presentation are usually quite negative. In education, there are also reports of teachers who simply read the powerpoint slide text to their students (Gurrie and Fair, 2008; O\u2019Quigley, 2011; Young, 2004). Educators are clearly not immune to the teleprompter problem. Several reasons explain why reading the slides to an audience is a poor presentation technique. The audience can read the text faster than the speaker can speak it out loud, which leads to the audience waiting for the presenter to catch up with them. In addition, multimedia theories of learning suggest that it is",

A third problem is that reading large text passages from a projection screen focuses the speaker\u2019s attention in the wrong place. The teleprompter approach makes the speaker face the screen to read the text rather than facing the audience. The solution to the teleprompter problem is to reduce the amount of text that is displayed to the audience. If notes are needed, they should be hidden from the audience on note cards or the PowerPoint \u201cnotes\u201d view that is not visible to the students. Another strategy is to thoroughly practice the presentation before going in front of an audience. Well-practiced presenters can give their presentations from memory. Going without notes gives the presentation a spontaneous, fresh kind of feeling, as though the speaker is interacting naturally with the audience.",

This cognitive limitation means that key terms and brief outlines are the most effective for learning. In contrast, long sentences and paragraphs become problematic due to the increased amount of information. Large quantities of text just don\u2019t fit into the low-density requirements of powerpoint presentations. The problem of too much text often relates to the first problem of reading text directly from a slide. Using powerpoint as a teleprompter requires a lot of text on the slides because the slides must contain the entire speech. Thus, problem #1 (reading from the slide) and problem #2 (too much text) tend to occur together. In addition, using a lot of text requires a small font size to make all of the text fit on to the slide. This problem leads us to yet another common problem: low visibility.",

In these situations, the presenter refers the audience to information on the slide, but the audience can barely see it. Maybe the students in the front row can see it with some effort. The students in the back, however, might not see the important information at all. The information on a powerpoint slide is simply not helpful if the audience cannot see it. Sometimes, the visibility problem is caused by the amount of text required when using powerpoint as a teleprompter (Problem",

Most visibility problems actually result from using powerpoint in an inappropriate manner to convey excessive amounts of information (see Chapters 10 and 11 about the problems of overload). Another source of visibility problems stems from the classroom presentation environment being significantly different from the office computer screen. Text and images that look fine on the teacher\u2019s office computer screen might seem tiny when viewed from a distance in a large classroom. Likewise, color combinations and themes that look good in the office might look washed out or different in the classroom due to differences in the projected image and ambient lighting (see Chapter 7). Teachers give a lot of presentations, and they may not have enough time to test each one before giving it to a class. Consequently, visibility failures are often noticed only when the presentation is being given to the students, and, if the teachers stay close to the screen, they may not notice these visibility failures at all. When a visibility failure occurs, a good practice is for the instructor to make a note of this problem in order to address it before giving the presentation again. One means of doing so is using the \u201cinsert comment\u201d feature on a problematic PowerPoint slide (Figure 4.1). This note provides a useful reminder of a problem that can be fixed when preparing the file for the next class.",

Powerpoint changed presentations by offering a much richer range of sensory possibilities, particularly visual features such as flying bullet points, fancy slide designs, dynamic slide transitions, clip art, stock photography, 3-D graphs, and a broad assortment of colors. Designers use these features with the good intentions of making their powerpoint presentations more dynamic and interesting. Teachers in particular often face the task of presenting dry academic information to audiences of unmotivated, disinterested students. Teachers often hope that adding vibrant graphics or zooming bullet points to a presentation will stimulate student attention. The special effects may seem like a quick solution to adding interest to an otherwise dull presentation. The problem with special animations and fanciful graphics is they fail to meet the long-term goal of maintaining audience interest (see Chapters 5 and 10). These special effects may receive some student interest at first, but the interest only lasts a brief moment. After that, these special effects can become a distracting or even fatiguing experience for the students, especially if they occur again and again over the classroom period. Teachers need to resist the urge to fix boring presentations by adding unnecessary special effects. The real solution for the problem of dull topics needs to focus on improving the educational content or the story line of the presentation. The gratuitous use of unnecessary animations and graphics has become the hallmark of amateurish presentations. Examples of this bad practice often appear in student presentations. Students sometimes attempt to pump-up their presentations and make them more special by adding special effects of various kinds.",

    "text": "No significant concern about technology failures occurred when chalkboards were the height of teaching technology. Today\u2019s presentation technology is much more fragile, which can lead to presentation disasters caused by technical failures. Students and teachers find it frustrating when valuable class time is spent fixing technology problems instead of teaching (Young, 2004). Sometimes technology problems are unavoidable and cannot be anticipated. For example, projector bulbs can blow out at surprising moments, leaving the instructor without a critical resource. Not much can be done about random failures in technology when these occur. In these situations, the short-term goal is to improvise your way through the class period, without a powerpoint presentation to show. The long-term goal is to fix the system after class is done. A greater concern is when technology problems are caused by reasons that can be controlled by the teacher, such as a lack of adequate preparation. Teachers need to be certain that the",

    "text": "projection technology in the classroom is compatible with the software in the office they used to develop the presentation. For example, presentations prepared on an Apple Macintosh computer might not be fully compatible with a PC-based system that uses Microsoft PowerPoint. The cables that connect a computer to a projector come in a range of connector styles (VGA, DVI, HDMI), which creates another potential source of incompatibility. It\u2019s easy to forget that the powerpoint file must be transferred from the office to the classroom somehow. Instructors must check links to web pages or videos on YouTube before class because sometimes these resources disappear. It is disappointing to work up to a critical moment in a lecture for a short video clip only to find that it has been removed from YouTube. Similarly, sometimes web pages or YouTube clips can take some time to load, which again creates dead space at an otherwise important moment. Instructors need practice and training to become proficient with classroom technology, such as wireless presentation devices and student response systems. If you are new to a particular classroom technology, it might be worthwhile to take some time to learn how these systems work before attempting to use them with students during class time. Unfortunately, most teachers and professors receive very little training in the use of classroom technology. The responsibility of learning how these complex systems work often falls on the individual faculty member, who doesn\u2019t have much time to learn new technology. The result is that teachers often learn new technology by trial and error while they are in the midst of teaching.",

    "text": "Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint program has two basic modes of operation. The default view that comes up when the program is launched is an authoring mode. This view displays all of the menus, buttons, and tools that a presenter might need to create a slide deck, as well as small views (thumbnails) of each individual slide. When it is time to present, the program can go into a full- screen mode called \u201cslide show\u201d that displays only the slides. The various authoring tools are hidden during the slide show because they are unnecessary and would just distract the audience from the presenter\u2019s message. The full-screen mode is the standard view for giving a presentation. The difference between the authoring mode and the full- screen presentation mode may seem obvious to most PowerPoint users. However, some presenters prefer to give presentations in the authoring mode, with all of the buttons, tabs, and other development tools visible to the audience. Some powerpoint users are apparently uncomfortable with giving presentations in the slide show mode. However, giving presentations in the authoring mode is clearly a bad presentation practice because the buttons and other software features, not to mention the presence of the other slides in the queue, are a distraction to the audience. Giving a presentation in the authoring mode also reduces the size of the primary slide, which can amplify some of the visibility problems already mentioned. The accomplished presenter needs to be well-practiced in the ways of PowerPoint navigation, even when the program is",

    "text": "The too much information problem occurs for several reasons. Presentations need to be information-light, but the goal of educators is that students need to learn as much as possible. These competing needs are not always easy to resolve. Furthermore, instructors have no clear-cut standard to follow for deciding how much information is the right amount for a class period. Too much information is undesirable, but too little content is not good either. This ambiguous situation leaves it up to the instructor to judge the degree of content to be covered. There really is no substitute for experience as a guide for how much information is the right amount. Feedback is also important. After a classroom presentation, teachers should take a moment to assess how well the class period went. If there was too much or too little content, it is a good practice to note, possibly even in the slide deck (see Figure 4.1), that the degree of content for this class period needs to be adjusted up or down before giving the presentation again. Another strategy for dealing with the degree of content question is to rely on external aids to deliver some of the content. Tufte (2006) and other business communication experts recommend the use of handouts for carrying the high-density information that might complement the main messages of an information-light presentation (see Chapters 10 and 11). The idea is that the main themes of the presentations are fleshed out with the details from the handout. Both mediums have their strengths, and these can work together in a complementary way.",

Bullet points may have a strong appeal to business people who emphasize a bottom-line, expeditious way of handling matters. It has become ubiquitous in modern society to distill complex topics into clean, itemized lists. However, the use of bullet points may encourage teachers to overemphasize lists and sequences. Some educators have criticized the overly structured, highly linear nature of information delivered in bullet points (C. Adams, 2006) Bullet points may also suggest an overly simplified view of a topic and thereby lead to passive note-taking and disengaged learning.",

    "text": "send them back to me, with the chief problem being a need for more \u201cstory.\u201d When pressed, my dissertation adviser could never quite articulate exactly what he meant by the need for a story, so the concept was rather elusive. At first, it seemed to me that stories were really quite unnecessary for scientific research. I believed all that my writing really needed to do was report the facts to the reader in a straightforward way. In retrospect, it\u2019s clear that my early efforts at scientific writing had decent sentence mechanics. The real problem was that the writing failed to establish to the reader why the research was important or interesting. What I learned from this writing experience is that scientific papers need a carefully-constructed persuasive message about the importance of the study. The \u201cstory\u201d that my adviser was asking for was not a literal \u201cstory\u201d in the sense that there was a hero, a villain, and an epic struggle between good and evil. His use of the term \u201cstory\u201d simply meant that the document had to (1) communicate the importance to the reader; (2) present a problem worthy of investigation; (3) follow a logical, orderly sequence; and (4) arrive at a reasonable resolution to the issue. It would also be accurate to say that the scientific \u201cstory\u201d was a persuasive argument that presented ideas and information to the readers in a compelling way. Many powerpoint presentations have the same problem as my early attempts at scientific writing. The facts and information are excellent, but the importance, interesting features, and emotionally- compelling reasons for the topic are not communicated well to the audience. Information-rich but emotionally-flat presentations are ones in which an audience struggles to stay focused or, even worse, stay awake. They may communicate some information,",

    "text": "but they do not encourage the student to take this information to heart; alternatively, it may not sufficiently stimulate the student\u2019s mind. Much, perhaps even most, of a presentation\u2019s content is based upon nonverbal or emotional material (Duarte, 2010). To a significant degree, instructors should view presentations as a form of emotional communication rather than as the pure transmission of facts and information. The effective presentation is simply not a written report that that the teacher reads aloud. It might be tempting for teachers to think that emotions and persuasion are unimportant, just like I once thought that scientific writing was just getting the facts on paper. However, an effective teacher must firmly establish an emotional connection with the students at the beginning of each class. The students must be persuaded that the information is of high importance. This emotional connection is really a prerequisite for student learning. Students are unlikely to get involved in a topic if they cannot be convinced from the start that it is interesting and important. Another way to consider this situation is to examine the roles of the instructor and the textbook in a course. The textbook often contains all of the information that a student might need to master the key ideas of the course. We could, in theory, just assign the textbook to the students and give them a test at the end of the semester to see how well they have learned the content. In reality, however, this textbook-only approach just wouldn\u2019t work. Most people wouldn\u2019t read through a textbook on their own. It would just be too dull. The teacher is necessary to communicate passion and interest in the topic to the students, acting as a cheerleader to get students excited about the course content. The teacher provides emotional and social support for the students to help them achieve",

Important historical events were remembered in these societies through oral traditions, such as The Odyssey by Homer. These stories were passed down from generation to generation to preserve a cultural memory. Fables and religious texts also frequently use stories for teaching moral principles. Expressing important moral teachings in story form is much more persuasive than simply outlining key points with commands like \u201cspend money wisely\u201d or \u201cbe responsible.\u201d Although an ancient art, modern storytelling is still successfully used for teaching. Many award-winning documentaries are simply stories that have embedded facts and information into the overall framework of the story. Information presented in a narrative form works well because our brains are essentially wired to remember information in a story form. Human long-term memory for personally-experienced events is a kind of personal history, a story about our lives. The distinguished biologist Edward Wilson expressed it this way in an article that promoted the use of stories in science education:",

    "text": "Although a common analogy is to compare brain functions to a computer, human cognition and memory does much more than simply process and store information. The human brain excels at connecting the information between data points through an associative process that ultimately ends in story-like memories. Evidence for the story-like nature of memory comes from cognitive psychology research on memory. It may seem like memory should be an exact duplicate of an event that has been experienced, somewhat like a video recording. The truth is not so simple. Human memory is more accurately understood as being reconstructive in nature. This means memory is partly the real information from the event that was experienced plus a plausible explanation that fits our expectations. These combine to produce a memory experience that is similar to reliving the original event from our lives. Our memory for personal events, which is called autobiographical memory, is experienced as being a story, with ourselves as the central character. Neurobiological evidence for story-like functions in the brain comes from the study of the so-called \u2018split-brain\u2019 patients. These were a small number of people with severe epilepsy who were treated with a radical surgery that separated the two cerebral hemispheres. Michael Gazzaniga, the world\u2019s leading expert on these cases, found that the left hemisphere of these special patients seemed to have an \u201cinterpreter\u201d function (Gazzaniga, 2000). The interpreter links together environmental events into plausible explanations\u2014stories\u2014of events or cause and effect relationships that are taking place.",

Confabula- tion occurs when the interpreter function in these people keeps on operating, despite the loss of memory, taking whatever information is available in the mind and making a story out of it. The result is fabricated stories, some of which might be quite fantastic and im- possible, that are experienced by the patient as being real memories. Altogether, this evidence suggests that important human memory functions are understood and stored in a story-like, narrative fashion. Accordingly, information that fits into these story-like brain functions will be readily processed by the brain. This is why stories are effective structures for presentations.",

The problem with this approach is that starting with the technology leads to presentations that are more like technical events than engaging presentations (Ohler, 2005). A typical fault is that many powerpoint presentations lack an adequate beginning that engages the students. In our passion for our topic, the teacher who is designing a presentation may launch into the details of the content without adequately establishing to our audience why this topic is interesting, important, and potentially useful.

    "text": "The presenter should begin by asking themselves questions about the purpose of the presentation. What is the important message that needs to be conveyed to the audience? Why should someone who doesn\u2019t know much about this field care about this topic? What about this topic is exciting to me, and how do I communicate this excitement to others? The important idea is to start by determining what the audience needs and then working to meet their needs. Duarte (2010, p. 4) eloquently expresses the situation like this: \u201cThe audience does not need to tune themselves to you\u2014 you need to tune your message to them.\u201d The presenter must put their own needs aside in order to focus on what the audience really wants or needs. Once the audience needs are established, it is important to consider the overall structure and organization of the presentation. Good presentations are like stories with plot lines that follow a well-known structure (Duarte, 2010). The typical fiction story begins with a likeable hero. After the audience gets to know the hero, a challenge or dilemma occurs that throws the hero\u2019s life out of balance. Will the hero succeed in overcoming this challenge? The hero may face many obstacles during the middle section of the story. In the end, the challenge is overcome, hopefully with a happy ending for everyone who is involved. An inspiring presentation successfully incorporates the main elements of a story structure. The beginning sets the stage for the importance of the lesson. In fiction, this beginning is sometimes referred to as the \u201ccall to adventure\u201d (Ohler, 2005) or \u201ccall to action\u201d (Duarte, 2010). We become personally invested as the characters face a significant challenge that they must address. It would be a stretch to call most classroom settings an adventure. However, the",

The instructor should address the question of \u201cWhy should I care?\u201d at the beginning of the presentation. A significant barrier to engagement is student cynicism about the value of courses. At the college level, freshmen and sophomores commonly think that core courses are wasted time, something to \u201cget out of the way\u201d before the major courses are taken. At the K-12 levels, students often fail to appreciate the real-world relevance of topics. Math problems, for example, may seem to be esoteric exercises in abstraction or pointless puzzles. Teachers need enthusiasm and creativity to engage these difficult audiences. The teacher must start by being a persuasive salesperson. The goal is to draw the students into our world and show them the new intellectual possibilities, which is a task that is often difficult to accomplish. It is a common trap for experts, such as teachers, to think that the importance of the course content must be obvious to everyone. The truth, however, is that our students lack the experience and specialized knowledge that we, the teachers, already have. It may not be apparent to students why math is important or why they should care about historical events that happened long ago. Teachers must meet the students at the level where they are currently at in order to engage them in the course content. The teacher has many possible ways to engage student interest. One way is to connect academic topics to events from everyday life.

It occurred to me that the constitutional debate about the power relationship between the states and the federal government is still quite relevant today. Many current political issues revolve around the question of whether the states or the federal government have the right to regulate firearms, abortions, drugs, immigration, and other controversial issues. This relevance to modern political struggles would be a natural opening for this topic. A savvy history professor could open with, \u201cWho do you think should regulate ____, the states or the federal government?\u201d After a brief discussion, the natural segue would be something like, \u201cYou know, the founders of this country struggled with this question, too.\u201d Once the relevance of this issue to modern life is established, students might be sufficiently intrigued to explore how this problem has been treated in the past. A second approach for engaging student interest is to tap into curiosity about our complex world. Human beings have inborn curiosity. Some people also have a need for cognitive stimulation. An example opening line for this strategy is, \u201cHave you ever wondered why ____?\u201d When I teach about color vision, I often open class with this question: \u201cAs a child, did you ever wonder if other people internally experienced colors like you do? Perhaps what I experience as being the color green you might experience as being a different color.\u201d This question usually brings up some head nodding in agreement and brief discussions about how it is impossible to know exactly what other people are experiencing as colors.

    "text": "common color vision deficiencies (different between people). The conversation might eventually lead to how we can determine that some people are insensitive to certain colors through careful testing procedures. This may answer the opening question by demonstrating that not everyone may experience color in the same way. A third story-like way to engage student interest is through biographies or the chronological unfolding of events. Sometimes, presentations can start with literal stories. The presentation can describe an important person\u2019s life, and then the contributions and ideas that this person had fit within the context of the personal story. Many documentaries take this approach. A fourth idea for opening a class is to appeal to personal interests. Many college students are interested in career possibilities, such as how much money they could earn in certain occupations. Instructors can use this personal interest of students to stimulate their interest in the class topic. In Statistics, I tell my students that many statistical experts have salaries over $70,000 per year. This information often surprises students who tend to view data analysis as a boring waste of time. When I cover clinical topics in other courses, such as sensory deficits, neurological disorders, and psychological disorders, I sometimes mention how many professionals work in these fields and earn good incomes. Of course, most students will not pursue these clinical careers, and extrinsic rewards should not be the sole motivation for learning, but the mere mention of occupational possibilities is enough to demonstrate that a pressing need exists for this particular knowledge in the real world. These topics are not just esoteric or pointless academic exercises.",

    "text": "A fifth idea is to use foreshadowing to create intrigue about upcoming topics. In literature, foreshadowing occurs when narrators give subtle hints about the outcome of the story. These suggestions about the direction of the topic are engaging because people are interested in anticipating the outcome of future events. For presenters, a useful tool for starting a presentation is to give a brief outline of what the students can expect. A mental roadmap can give students a general feeling of the overall purpose and flow of the presentation. Finally, a last possibility is to make a connection to previous topics. This connection can help students put the current content into a bigger context and make connections across class periods. For some topics, such as math, there is a definite progression of ideas as the course proceeds. I often take time at the beginning of each Statistics class to draw attention to how today\u2019s topic is related to and builds upon the topic that I covered during the last class period. This connection shows that today\u2019s ideas are not just random, isolated thoughts. Rather, the current topic is another step forward in a logical progression of ideas. All information needs to be understood in a context. A brief review of a relevant previous topic helps to establish the context for new ideas and thus orients student learning.",

    "text": "the problem in this phase of the class is that the emotional energy that started at the beginning of the class can slowly decline and become lost. A lecture that starts off on a high note and then slowly grinds down to dull facts will not be effective. Teachers need to be aware of this diminishing emotional energy as the class period proceeds and take appropriate measures to keep the classroom energy high until the end. One strategy for maintaining the emotional energy of a class session is to follow the drier academic ideas with educational activities or multimedia resources that stimulate a higher level of student engagement. Instructors can follow a period of lecture information with a discussion activity or a hands-on demonstration. Another possibility is to illustrate a concept with a video example of the key idea. When I cover psychological disorders in the Introductory Psychology course, I follow a fact-example sequence. The sequence starts with a brief lecture about the symptoms and causes of each disorder. This emotionally-dry information is followed with short video clips (about three to five minutes long) of people who display symptoms of these disorders. This fact- example sequence accomplishes at least two desirable goals. One benefit is that the brief video gives students an emotional boost after listening to the dry lecture material. Watching real people do things is interesting and intriguing, so the example helps to maintain student interest. Another benefit is that I can ask students to identify the specific symptoms in the video clip, which turns the video into a more engaging active learning process. Another emotional strategy that can help students through the middle part of a presentation is to introduce some humor at opportune moments (Berk, 2003). The students don\u2019t really",

The goal is to use safe, simple humor like harmless one-liner jokes and puns, which Berk (2003) describes as \u201clow stakes humor.\u201d Good judgment must be used to avoid humor that has the potential to be offensive to students. Jokes that are racist or sexist, for example, might be a quick end to an academic career. Leave the provocative humor to the professional comedians in the comedy clubs. The classroom is not an appropriate place for pushing the socially acceptable limits of comedy. Humor can be particularly effective if you can find a joke or cartoon that is highly relevant to the course content. A good cartoon in the middle of a powerpoint slide deck can do a double duty by simultaneously illustrating an important concept and giving the audience an emotional boost. These moments provide a means for the presenter to really reach the audience on both the intellectual and emotional levels. Don\u2019t just use any random joke or cartoon.

The ending of a presentation is a good place to reiterate some key points from the overall presentation. The goal should be to bring the various content details together to give the students a holistic overview of the topic before the class ends. Efforts to bring closure to the topic may be helpful for long-term memory. Memory research has demonstrated that the last bit of information is recalled better than other information, which is a phenomenon called the \u201crecency principle.\u201d Although this phenomenon is usually studied in the lab, it seems likely that the recency principle would also hold true for presentations (Duarte, 2010, p. 44). The ending is, therefore, an important last chance to leave students with a particularly memorable idea. The very best presentations end on an uplifting, possibly inspirational note (Duarte, 2010). For an example, think of the greatest speeches in American history, such as Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech. An ideal outcome would be for students to leave the class with a sense of wonder, excitement, or curiosity that might be helpful for motivating their further studies.

    "text": "and adding some activities that stimulate emotion in the middle. Carefully consider, however, an opposite extreme. If presentations have too much emotion, these strong feelings can overwhelm the academic message and be detrimental to learning. Instructors face the real risk of having too much style and not enough substance when trying to add emotion to their presentations. This situation might be emotionally satisfying to the audience yet provide little benefit for their educational needs. A fitting analogy is that the emotion in a presentation is like putting some seasoning on food. A small amount of salt or hot sauce makes food taste better. Likewise, students will appreciate having a bit of emotion and humor added to the educational material. It will spark some interest in the topic and facilitate learning. However, the chef should be careful not to get too carried away: too much salt or hot sauce can overwhelm the flavor. In a similar way, too much emotion in a classroom can be a distraction and be detrimental to learning. The use of graphics to increase the emotional content of a powerpoint presentation is generally a positive feature. However, doing so could also cause problems if the emotional images overwhelm the presentation\u2019s message. Educational psychologists use the term \u201cseductive details\u201d to describe a similar phenomenon that can occur in textbooks or multimedia presentations (Mayer, 2009). Many textbooks attempt to be more appealing by including images to liven up the textbook content. The potential problem with seductive details is that some of these images are not important for learning the topic and do little or nothing to promote student understanding. In fact, these unnecessary emotional details may even be harmful to learning. For example, many Introductory",

    "text": "Psychology textbooks will have a picture of a sleeping person in the chapter that covers sleep as a state of consciousness. The purpose of the picture is to generate interest, but such a picture is hardly necessary because everyone has seen someone who is asleep at some point in their lives. The problem is that students might remember the picture of the sleeping person but forget the important information about sleep that was described in the text. It seems likely that the seductive detail effect can occur in powerpoint presentations, such as with graphics that add little or nothing to the presentation\u2019s content. The danger is that the audience may remember a good cartoon or a memorable picture but forget the important content of the presentation. Interestingly, the results from seductive details research are somewhat inconsistent. Earlier studies suggest that the irrelevant emotions triggered by unnecessary information may harm learning, but more recent studies suggest potentially positive benefits (Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn, 2001; Park, Flowerday, and Br\u00fcnken, 2015; Rey, 2012; Schneider, Nebel, and Rey, 2016). These mixed research findings suggest that the role of emotions in education can be somewhat tricky. Sometimes emotional content is helpful for learning, and sometimes it is not.",

The graphics can add an emotional spark to the presentation.

    "text": "much class time is spent off-topic. These unfortunate situations illustrate a need for order in effective teaching. Spontaneity is good, but it can be a potential problem if the class seems to get lost due to a lack of structure. Balancing order and flexibility is important for being an effective educator. Powerpoint presentations can be both an aid and a hindrance to teaching goals due to the competing demands of order and spontaneity. Powerpoint imposes a structure and order upon a presentation that can be beneficial. Students approve of powerpoint\u2019s organizing effects for note-taking and the overall structure of a lecture (Susskind, 2005). On the other hand, some educators are concerned that powerpoint presentations can be too linear or excessively organized (Hlynka and Mason, 1998). A high degree of powerpoint structure may stifle student questions and discussion if the students feel that it is impossible for the class to deviate from the predetermined course of the slide deck. Powerpoint may also make controversial topics with ambiguous evidence seem to have an artificial sense of order. The linear nature of a powerpoint presentation may therefore be problematic for situations that require a more complex, intricate understanding of relationships (Kinchin et al., 2008). We will now examine the role of structure in a successful powerpoint presentation.",

    "text": "A common problem in lectures is that the teacher simply launches into to the main body of the topic without adequately preparing students (see Chapter 5). It is a mistake to begin a lecture with the facts and key terms that form the body of the lecture. The first part of a successful lecture needs to take a preparatory step by informing students about what the topic is and why it is important. We cannot assume that students bring the same level of interest and understanding to the topic that teachers already possess. Teachers must, therefore, carefully cultivate an interest or intellectual curiosity about the topic before the lecture moves into the main part with facts and information. Teachers can start the process of building student interest before the lecture has even started. An easy yet very useful technique for promoting student interest is to begin with a dramatic title slide. This slide should contain a short title, a compelling graphic image that is relevant to the topic, and possibly a brief outline (just a few words) of the topics to be covered.

Another possibility for increasing intrigue is to make a \u2018promise\u2019 in the title slide followed by an ellipsis: \u201cYour PowerPoint Slides are About to Get So Much Better. . .\u201d. It is a good practice to begin projecting this introductory slide about five minutes before the class starts (Kosslyn, 2007). At least a few students will have their interest drawn in by a dramatic image on the title slide. The best part about this approach is that it takes almost no effort on the part of the instructor to spark some interest. When the class begins, many possible introductions might capture student interest at the beginning of the lecture. The common element of these openings is their intention to intrigue students and motivate them to learn more. Some introduction possibilities are introductory stories, emphasizing curiosity and relevance to everyday life, and appealing to personal interests (see Chapter 5). Even when student interest is not aroused, making the effort to engage students is still worthwhile. Students who are not emotionally moved by these engagement efforts likely will appreciate the instructor\u2019s attempt to draw their interest into the topic.",

This application stage may also involve a more active learning process than simple comprehension or memorization. The slides or other media shown during this part of the lecture need to emphasize examples rather than delivering more information. This need can be accomplished through the use of images, video clips, and/or instructional animations, but these examples must be relevant to the instructional content. Another way to provide an example is through a hands-on demonstration of some sort. Regardless of how they present the example, the instructor\u2019s role during this application is to guide the students through the example to show how the application should be done. This guidance is important because the students may not be ready in this stage to apply the concept completely on their own. They may still need an expert role model to point the way. Students benefit from the change of focus or activities that occurs in the application phase because they cannot continually absorb more information without experiencing fatigue and decreased learning. Changing up the format of a lecture is an important component of effective lectures (Bligh, 2000). For example, switching from information delivery to watching a short video clip changes the dynamic of the lecture and helps to keep students engaged in the topic.",

This part of class is for the higher level cognitive skills of Bloom\u2019s taxonomy: application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and/or creation. The students have some freedom to run with the ideas of the day and use them in their own way, giving this this part of class a constructivist approach.

For controversial ideas, the instructor can emphasize using evidence to carefully evaluate two or more competing options, and then make an informed decision about which viewpoint seems to be the most accurate. The concluding phase of class could have a metacognitive emphasis, such as having students identify what they perceived to be the main ideas or difficult topics of the day\u2019s lesson. An example is the two-minute paper exercise, which allows students two minutes to write their overall reaction to what they learned during class. This type of assignment can help students consolidate information into long- term memory and also give the instructor feedback about what the students got out of the class session. The slides during this part of class should emphasize holistic conclusions that summarize the class period. For this purpose, a powerpoint slide could contain a few complete sentences that effectively summarize the key points from the class period. The purpose for using complete sentences is to encourage complete thoughts. Ending a class period with video clips, discussions, or demonstrations may fail. The reason for this problem is that the last slide in the slide deck will send a strong signal to students that the class is done. The students will interpret the last slide as an ending even if the instructor does not intend to send this message.",

Teachers also need to be aware that students may have reservations about interrupting the predetermined slide sequence with questions. Being sensitive to the basic linear nature of powerpoint is an important starting point for addressing these shortcomings. We must be aware of the potential problems posed by the slide structure before we can seek solutions to overcome it. second step toward promoting student-teacher communication is to explicitly inform students that they have permission to ask questions, and that asking questions is encouraged. A good time to introduce this idea is on the first day of class. Teacher-student dialogue can be promoted during the first and second weeks of class by seeking student opinions. Teachers can demonstrate that they are sincere about teacher-student communication during class by positively reinforcing students who ask questions. These words and deeds early in the course will show students that your individual style is open to questions and observations. Teachers will also find it useful to plan for discussion opportunities while preparing their slide decks. Some natural points in the class may occur in which student discussion is most likely or appropriate. The overall structure can cover the topic, yet",

    "text": "the instructor can set aside a few key moments for students to ask questions or engage in a discussion-based activity. Natural points for questions might be transitions between topics, such as moving from the information-focused parts of a lecture to an application exercise or an activity. The application and challenge parts of the lecture (see above) might also be good times for student-teacher interactions. For example, instructors can follow video clips with a question and answer period. If the students have no questions themselves, the instructor can pose questions to the students about the video that might encourage application of the concepts or other higher-order thinking activities. A tip for promoting discussions is that the best questions will be specific and focused rather than vague and open-ended. For example, let\u2019s say that following a discussion of the symptoms of schizophrenia, a class was shown a video with examples of the disorder. The instructor-posed question, \u201cWhich behavior illustrated the presence of hallucinations?\u201d might be more likely to get an answer that promotes discussion compared to an unfocused question like, \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d If someone gives a partial answer, the instructor can promote further discussion by saying something like, \u201cThat was good. What other symptoms did you notice?\u201d Doing so encourages other students to build upon partial answers in a collaborative manner. Instructors can use the powerpoint slide itself to encourage classroom interaction. The slides can directly encourage questions and discussion by communicating to students that the class direction is changing to discussion. One possible approach is to use a blank slide to break away from the tendency to deliver more information and refocus attention on the teacher. Perhaps",

Aim to keep these discussion-promoting questions short. A one-word questions like, \u201cSymptoms?\u201d might be more effective than using an entire sentence, such as, \u201cWhich symptoms does this person have?\u201d In order to encourage discussion, these slides should not provide further information. Students should not be writing down more information when the real goal is engagement in a discussion activity. Knoblauch (2012) reports that the contents of a powerpoint slide can often be a common point of discussion for presenters and the audience. In education, an informative graph or an intriguing image presented without text may be a good way to stimulate discussion. For example, Maxwell reports successfully using powerpoint in history classes to present primary sources such as photos rather than bullet point lists of information (Maxwell, 2007). He stimulates class discussion by showing dramatic images of historical events. One of his examples is the impact of hyperinflation in Germany before World War II. He illustrates this historical event through the use of photos that show people using paper money to light a stove or using money as waste paper. These moving images are much more likely to promote student interest and discussion than a dry bullet point item like \u201chyperinflation was a problem.\u201d Some technology solutions may also help to provide more flexibility from the predetermined order of the slide deck.

This feature reveals thumbnail images of all the slides and allows the presenter to jump to any slide in the slide deck. The online version of PowerPoint has a similar \u201cgo to slide\u201d option that can jump to a particular slide number. Yet another possibility is to enter the slide number into the keyboard, and then press \u2018enter\u2019 to jump to a particular slide. Instructors can also make the order of powerpoint slides more flexible by using hyperlinks that can jump to predetermined slides or web pages. A situation in which the nonlinearity of hyperlinks might be useful is for questions and answers at the end of a presentation. The presenter could insert hyperlinks in the final slide that go to key slides in the presentation, such as a graph with important results. If a question arises about this graph, the presenter can jump to the graph by simply clicking on the hyperlink in the conclusion slide. One drawback, however, is that the instructor must build these hyperlinks into the slide deck before class. Other supplemental technologies can help powerpoint presentations be both more flexible and interactive. The oldest of these technologies is a chalkboard or whiteboard. They can offer a flexibility that nicely complements the inflexible structure of a slide deck. If a student asks a good question, the instructor can respond by writing key information on the board off to the side of the powerpoint projection. The instructor can provide this information in an improvisational way, adding text as the flow of discussion suggests. Smart boards and similar products represent a step up the technology ladder.

Student perceptions of Prezi are generally positive (Brock and Brodahl, 2013; Conboy, Fletcher, Russell, and Wilson, 2012; Virtanen, Myll\u00e4rniemi, and Wallander, 2013). However, studies of educational effectiveness that compare PowerPoint to Prezi do not find higher student performance with Prezi (Castelyn and Mottart, 2012; Castelyn, Mottart, and Valcke, 2013; Chou, Chang, and Lu, 2015). These negative results suggest that the linear nature of powerpoint presentations is perhaps not a major problem. Kinchin and colleagues address the linearity of powerpoint by supplementing powerpoint presentations with handouts that have information organized in a nonlinear fashion (Kinchin, 2006a, 2006b; Kinchin and Cabot, 2007; Kinchin et al., 2008). These handouts have concept maps that present the same information as the powerpoint presentation, but the handout\u2019s organization of information better reflects the nonlinear complexities of the subject matter. These educators suggest that the combination of a linear powerpoint presentation with a nonlinear concept map on a handout is a powerful combination for promoting student learning. Using handouts in this fashion is a strategy worth considering for educators who might be concerned about the potential problems created by the linear structure of powerpoint presentations.",

In one study, only 17% of the surveyed students felt that the predetermined order of a powerpoint slide presentation was a significant problem (D. Burke and Apperley, 2003). However, while teachers must provide their students with a path to follow, learning is often not as straightforward as staying on a particular path. The students must, to some degree, find their own way as they learn. All learning is a bit constructivist in nature as students find their own understanding of the material. This need for each student to discover their own way sometimes makes learning a nonlinear process, one with diversions, dead-ends, and convoluted turns. The creative use of powerpoint navigation can be used to address these nonlinear teaching moments in a manner that is effective and exciting in the classroom.",

Photons, which are the particles and waves that make up light, have the ability to strike objects and bounce off. This reflected light energy from our environment is spread unevenly, with some areas of the environment being darker (e.g., shadows) and others being lighter (e.g., full sun). This uneven distribution of light energy provides important information about our environment, such as the size of objects and depth information. The reflected light, which is called \u201cluminance,\u201d eventually enters our eye and is converted into a nervous system signal in the retina at the back of the eye. The visual function of being able to sense comparatively lesser or greater amounts of light throughout our environment is called \u201ccontrast sensitivity.\u201d The idea of contrast sensitivity is illustrated in the two following examples of powerpoint slides (Figure 7.1). The backgrounds in these slides vary in luminance, from darker (top) to lighter (bottom) areas. The text is a constant color of white (left) or black (right). Contrast sensitivity allows us to distinguish the text\u2014the foreground\u2014as being separate from the background. A high degree of difference is easy to read.",

When the contrast is high\u2014such as light text on a dark background or dark text on a light background\u2014words will be very legible and easy to read. For this primary reason, books are typically printed as black text on white paper. Low contrast situations, such as light text on a light background or dark text on a dark background, are difficult to read. Our first best practice conclusion for visibility is that presenters need slides with high contrast in order to promote visibility and easy reading. Low contrast is simply too difficult for the audience to see. Under low contrast situations, the text seems to disappear. Which is the best way to achieve high contrast? Figure 7.1 shows the two possible ways to accomplish high contrast: dark text on light backgrounds, or light text on dark backgrounds. The best approach depends on the presentation context, with the most critical factor being the degree of the ambient light in the classroom. Some presentation experts, usually from the field of business, recommend light text on dark backgrounds for a professional look. This recommendation is particularly good for small classrooms. The dark background is easy on the eyes for people who are seated near",

It\u2019s problematic, therefore, to use black backgrounds in bright rooms with a high degree of ambient light. The light coming from various sources will strike the screen and make the dark parts of the slide appear much lighter. For example, a black background can become more like grey in a room with strong ambient lighting (Figure 7.2). The implication is that black or dark backgrounds will look best in dark rooms without much ambient light. The practical problem that this may pose is that, as already mentioned, darkened rooms may put students to sleep and cause difficulties for note-taking efforts. Students may also find it difficult to see the instructor in a dark room.",

The black text on a white background seems to have higher contrast, and therefore greater visibility, in this lighting situation. Another advantage of this approach is that the classroom lights do not need to be turned off during the presentation, because the white light projected on the screen is much brighter than most of the ambient lighting. A white slide with black letters under high ambient lighting conditions is shown in Figure 7.3. This photo was taken from the side of a classroom approximately twenty-two feet (6.7 meters) away from the projection screen. The screen is approximately twelve feet (3.7 meters) wide. Even though the slide is designed to be high contrast\u2014black text on a white background\u2014the intensity of ambient light from the windows and other sources significantly lowers the contrast. This effect makes the black font appear to be a washed out grey color and shows that it is best to aim for the highest possible contrast. Lower degrees of contrast would be even harder to discern under conditions with significant ambient lighting.",

Overlaying the the text on to a photo can be dramatic and is sometimes recommended by presentation experts. However, the uneven contrast may create visibility problems. For example, the text that is superimposed on the darker parts of the photo (such as the middle row of text) is simply not visible due to low contrast.

Most teachers lack the professional design expertise needed to make complicated photographic slides that are appealing yet highly readable, although the latest versions of Microsoft PowerPoint can provide helpful design suggestions for these tricky situations.

    "text": "An everyday example of this phenomenon that most people can relate to is the visual acuity testing done in optometry clinics. The standard test of visual acuity is to read black letters from a white chart. The classic Snellen test of visual acuity determines the smallest line of letters than can be seen at a distance of twenty feet (six meters). A diagnosis of 20/20 (6/6 in meters) means that the patient can see letters at twenty feet that the average person should also be able to view from twenty feet, which is a complicated way of saying someone has an average or normal visual acuity. Although the Snellen test is known to most people, modern optometrists and vision researchers use a more sophisticated measure of visual acuity called the degree of visual angle. As previously stated, the differences between the light and dark parts of the visual display form small angles as they travel through the lens of the eye. The degree of these angles can be used to measure the smallest differences in light intensity that people can reliably see. The practical question about spatial frequency for presenters is how small these differences (the degree of visual angle) between light and dark can be, yet still be distinguishable by the audience. For example, how small can a presenter make the text on a",

    "text": "powerpoint slide, yet still have text that is easy for the audience to read? If the text size falls below the spatial acuity ability of the audience, it will be nearly impossible to see, just like it is almost impossible to read the smallest lines on the eye chart at the optometrist\u2019s office. However, text that is too large may be overwhelming to people seated in the front row. Large text will also limit the amount of information that can be put on a slide, which could also be problematic. It would be convenient if the answer to this question was something simple, like, \u201cAlways use a 32 point font or larger.\u201d Although many articles make such suggestions, a simple recommendation for a specific font size doesn\u2019t completely work. The degree of visual angle for people in the audience will depend partly on the size of the image shown on the screen, which is determined by both the font size and the screen size. A second less obvious factor that influences the degree of visual angle is the audience members\u2019 distance from the slide. If the image size stays the same, the degree of visual angle will become smaller and smaller as the audience members get farther and farther away from the screen. Once again, the analogy of visual acuity testing is helpful. As you get farther away from the chart, the degree of visual angle for the chart letters becomes progressively smaller to you, making it harder to see the letters. The basic point is that the degree of visual angle is a relative measure that will depend both upon the size of the image on the screen and the viewer\u2019s distance from the screen. The relationship between screen size and distance for a hypothetical powerpoint slide is shown in the following Figure (5.6). The eyes of the nearby viewer (top) should have little or no",

    "text": "know the font size that works for your classroom, you can make this size a standard for all of your future presentations. A more technical way to consider this problem is to think of the visual acuity of an average viewer. If someone has an average 20/20 Snellen visual acuity, a five-letter word will take about a half degree of visual angle from left to right. This size might work for some students with good vision, but people with lower vision would likely struggle with words presented at this size. A general design recommendation is to aim for a larger size, such as words that are 1 to 2 degrees, in order to be more visible to people who have low visual acuity. You can use an easy method to quickly determine the visual angle of the text in your slides. If you stick your arm straight ahead and hold up your thumb, the width of your thumb will cover about two degrees of visual angle (Figure 7.7). You can use the thumb measure as a quick test for your slides in the classroom. If the width of your outstretched thumb is about the same width as most of the words on the screen, then your words have about two degrees of visual angle and will be easily visible to most students. If the thumb measure seems unnatural, you could simply go by your subjective impressions about visibility from the back of the classroom: Is this easy to read, or not? You can use other practical means to judge the size of the letters in a powerpoint presentation. One practical test is to print the powerpoint slides out on a standard sheet of paper and then place the sheets of paper on the floor. While standing over the sheets, ask yourself if you can read them easily. If the answer is no, the font size is too small and needs to be increased (Guetig, 2011).

    "text": "A third fundamental visual function is color vision, which is the perception of different light wavelengths in the visible light spectrum. Color information is important for guiding behavior, such as assisting honey bees to find flowers or enabling people to respond to traffic signals. Color perception may have enabled early human ancestors to distinguish food like ripe berries from the surrounding vegetation, which is usually green. People and animals who could detect these color differences may have had an evolutionary advantage over others who had more limited sensitivity. One of the major changes that occurred with powerpoint is that presenters were given a wide range of color possibilities. Most presentations use color to provide a positive aesthetic quality\u2014pretty slides\u2014and thereby add visual interest. Color may do more, though, than simply enhance the appearance of slides. Experimental evidence suggests that the presence of color can enhance memory for photographs, such as pictures of natural scenes like rock formations, fields, and forests (Homa",

    "text": "and Viera, 1988; Wichmann, Sharpe, and Gegenfurtner, 2002). In support of this idea, an early study that compared black and white presentation visual aids to color aids found that the addition of color increased comprehension and retention (Morrison and Vogel, 1998). Part of the reason why the presence of color might enhance memory is that color can make photographs more salient or prominent (Wichmann et al., 2002). A likely practical use of color in teaching, therefore, is to highlight important text or graphics. A \u201cpop\u201d of color can direct student attention to a particularly important part of the slide. This has also been called the signaling principle if teachers use color highlighting as a cue for pointing out important information (Mayer, 2009). This color highlighting will only work if the color is distinctive and stands out on the slide. When there are many colors, highlighted words or colored arrows may not be effective because the highlighted color will simply be lost in the kaleidoscope of colors on the slide. It is important to consider the potential emotions that colors can trigger (for a review, see Elliot and Maier, 2014). The color red is particularly noteworthy for being associated with strong emotions, like aggression, failure, losses, or danger. These strong reactions suggest that red is a color that should be used with caution because it may elicit emotional responses that are counterproductive to teaching. Other colors may also have emotional qualities, although these are not typically a strong as red. Pink is stereotypically associated with femininity, whereas blue is stereotypically associated with masculinity. Blue, green, and other cool colors are believed to have calming and generally positive emotional effects. Some of these color-",

    "text": "emotion associations may be based upon culture-specific values. For example, green is associated with money in the U.S.A because American currency is green, but this association is not necessarily true in other countries. The emotional values associated with certain colors suggest that the colors used in a presentation may have emotional effects upon audiences, and these effects might indirectly influence student learning. The audience might not be overtly aware of the influence, yet the emotions induced by color may have a measurable effect upon their behavior (Hanke, 1998). However, not much systematic color research on emotions has been done with powerpoint presentations. The use of color also has potential downsides. Certain color combinations can have conflicting or clashing effects when presented together. For text, presenting color opposites next to each other can make reading difficult and produce unsettling emotional qualities. For example, red text on a green background can produce a feeling of vibration or fuzziness (Figure 7.8, left). Blue text on a black background is also problematic because it makes the letters fuzzy and indistinct (Figure 7.8, right). Other poor color combinations include brown/green and blue/purple (Hanke, 1998)",

    "text": "Teachers must consider the possibility that some students will have visual impairments that require special accommodations. It would be mistaken to assume that all students will have normal visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. Slide designs must aim to be accessible to individuals with low vision in order to be inclusive for all students. Recall that visual acuity depends upon the relationship between the size of the object and the viewer\u2019s distance from the object (see Figure 7.6). This relationship suggests a simple solution for students with low visual acuity: These individuals should be encouraged to sit at the front of the classroom. Being as close as possible to the screen will increase the retinal image size and degrees of visual angle. This small change in behavior is an easy way to accommodate students with visual acuity impairments. Most teachers work with students who are young and have good visual sensitivity. However, we cannot take visual sensitivity for granted when the students are middle-aged or older. People over forty typically have presbyopia, a condition that produces difficulty in changing focus from near to far objects. This normal aging process may make it more difficult to focus on text and fine details. Older adults can also experience a wide range of additional visual insensitivities that may be caused by diseases or age-related changes in the visual system. Large fonts with high contrast will be best for these mature audiences. Regarding color, a significant proportion of people are insensitive to red and green wavelengths.

    "text": "diagrams, which shows that they are not blind, yet they cannot identify the objects that they see. One of the earliest and most influential approaches to understanding form perception was proposed by German psychologists in the early twentieth century. This movement was called Gestalt psychology, with the word German word \u201cgestalt\u201d translating into \u201cform\u201d or \u201cshape\u201d in English. A famous quotation from Kurt Koffka to describe the concept of gestalt was, \u201cThe whole is different from the sum of its parts\u201d (\u201cGestalt psychology,\u201d 2016). This means that the human mind makes connections between the parts of a system to arrive at a relationship or understanding that is different from merely perceiving the individual components. For example, when we look at a chair, we perceive it as a cohesive, single chair object and not as several separate objects (legs, seat, back) that just happen to be connected to each other. The Gestalt psychologists described several perceptual principles, or laws, that described how information was grouped into meaningful patterns. The Gestalt psychologists believed these rules were useful for much more than basic visual perception. For example, some of the Gestalt psychologists studied creativity. They felt that creative solutions occurred when people developed new perceptions of relationships between the components of a problem. Some of the Gestalt psychologists also proposed that Gestalt principles were important for education in that a teacher\u2019s role was to promote understanding by helping students perceive relationships between concepts (Wertheimer, 1959). The idea is that meaningful learning occurs when students mentally \u201csee\u201d relationships that are new to them and form a new perception of previously unrelated pieces of information.",

    "text": "The Gestalt laws can be used to help students make the proper associations between ideas and help to promote understanding. A good example to begin with is the Gestalt law of figure-ground, which states that visual information from a scene is segregated into a prominent, important point (the figure) which is distinct from the rest of the scene (the ground; Todorovic, 2008). The ground or background tends to be less important than the figure and, accordingly, receives less attention or processing. For powerpoint slides, this perceptual phenomenon suggests that each slide should have a main prominent feature that contains the essential information that the teacher is trying to convey. The remaining elements of the slide, such as background colors or patterns that surround the figure, will not have much impact on the audience. The segregation of visual information into a figure-ground relationship suggests that having too many features on a slide might overwhelm and visually confuse the audience. When a slide is complex, it becomes more difficult for the audience to segregate the information into a main point (figure) and background. The multiple slide elements compete with each other to become the figure. The real need in this situation is to edit the number of slide features downward to the most basic, essential features. This reduction in features will help the important figure part to stand out. Although this idea of simple design seems straightforward, it is sometimes difficult to accomplish in practice. Many other Gestalt grouping principles have been proposed (for a review, see Todorovic, 2008), with some being especially relevant to the design of slide graphics. The Gestalt law of proximity is that components that are physically near each other will be perceptually grouped together (Figure 8.1, upper left). This",

If we want to label a graph, for example, we should put the label next to the appropriate place on the graph. The Gestalt law of proximity would cause the audience to intuitively perceive that the label and the graph feature go together. In contrast, a label that is located far from the graph might seem odd and disconnected from its target object. In some situations, the proximity principle suggests that having appropriate text labels that are located near a visual feature that they belong to might be more effective than a text header placed at the top of the slide. The proximity principle may also be valuable for the layout of the slide elements. The parts that belong together should be placed in close proximity to each other to make it appear that they belong together.",

The white space between the upper and lower bullet points creates a separation that makes the proximity different between the upper and lower bullet points, thereby grouping them into two separate groups. Judicious use of spacing on powerpoint slides could thereby take advantage of the proximity principle to guide the audience to perceive certain elements as being together, which in turn could reduce the need for explanatory text on the slide and simplify the slide\u2019s appearance. The Gestalt law of similarity states that items with similar shapes, colors, and other characteristics form perceptual groups (Figure 8.1, upper right). The law of similarity can also be used to create groups of text that share a similar characteristic, like font families, styles, colors, or sizes. For the overall design, a suggestion based upon similarity is that the headings in a document should all be the same type and size. This will distinguish them from subheadings, all of which should, again, be similar in type and size. Each category throughout the document will seem to be a consistent and organized part of its family because the appearance is similar.",

    "text": "The law of connectedness makes items that are attached by a connector appear to be part of the same group (Figure 8.1, lower left). The practical use of this principle in a slide is to have labels that link to a particular spot on a diagram by an arrow or line. The presence of this line between the label and the diagram part will make these features into a perceptual group. These connectors are also useful for diagrams that involve flow charts or organizational charts. The relationship between units can be expressed by the presence or absence of connecting lines. The law of common region states that elements that are contained within a common boundary will seem to be part of the same group (Figure 8.1, lower right). Teachers can use this grouping principle to make groups from numerous elements. All you need to do is draw a circle or square around the elements to make the groups. This grouping effect naturally communicates to the audience the various groupings that might be present in the display and, again, may allow the presenter to simplify the slide appearance by reducing the need for explanatory text. Several Gestalt laws of perception are applied to a powerpoint slide in Figure 8.2 to illustrate how these grouping principles might be used. This slide, which is from a lecture on intelligence, is designed to show that people with cognitive disabilities make up approximately 2% of the overall population. The slide has a clean figure-ground organization because the graph of IQ scores stands out prominently from the white background. There are no decorations or other graphics that might compete or interfere with the figure-ground segregation. I used the Gestalt law of common region to group together the segments of the graph that represent the bottom 2% of IQ scores by drawing a box around this area of",

    "text": "motion. The processing of motion information continues all the way to the higher order areas of cerebral cortex, where some brain areas\u2014called V5 or MT\u2014specialize in the understanding of motion. The ability to perceive motion contributes greatly to our ability to survive in a dynamic environment. We are able to accurately judge the speed of oncoming cars and use this information to judge when it is safe to cross the street. Motion perception is a way of noticing and understanding the changes that occur in an ever-changing environment. In education, the use of animated presentations has been investigated as a way of promoting learning by using our built- in ability to perceive motion. The \u201cmotion paths\u201d feature in PowerPoint allows users to take objects, like squares or circles, and make them move in certain paths that are defined by the presentation author. This form of animation has potential instructional value by guiding students through a complicated process in a step by step manner. Instructors can also use animations to gradually build complexity in diagrams by adding features in a progressive fashion. This gradual building of information assists comprehension by decreasing the possibility of cognitive overload (Kosslyn, 2007). Another instructional use of animation is to promote the understanding of three-dimensional structures through the use of movement. For example, instructors can promote a deeper understanding of anatomy by displaying a three-dimensional model of brain anatomy through an animation that rotates brain images on the screen. Is animation an effective teaching tool? A review of studies that use animated multimedia for teaching reveals mixed results: some studies suggest improved learning with animation, whereas other",

    "text": "studies show no improvement (Fisk, 2008). A closer inspection of the research results suggests why animation is not always a successful instructional tool. Animated instructional materials seem to work best when the animations are closely aligned with the instructional goals (Rieber, 1996). An effective use of instructional animation is to show how relationships between the parts in a complex system change over time. For example, Treleven and colleagues developed a set of instructional animations for teaching operations management (Treleven, Penlesky, Callarman, Watts, and Bragg, 2012, 2014). They divided these instructional animations into two categories: quantitative technique examples and concepts. The technique examples included topics such as the computation of project time, project completion dates, safety stock/reorder points, and materials requirements planning. Examples of concept animations included group technology, project network diagrams, quality cost theory graphs, and Six Sigma quality graphs. The student opinion was that these complex instructional animations were valuable for learning. This example is a noteworthy illustration because it shows that animation can be beneficial for illustrating highly specific instructional concepts. Contrary to the above, some animations seem to have little to no educational benefit (Fisk, 2008). A good example comes from a study that used an animated, Einstein-like character called \u201cDr. Phyz\u201d to narrate an educational animation on the ways the electric motors work (Mayer, Dow, and Mayer, 2003). A control group of students saw the same educational animation but without the animated Dr. Phyz character. The results from this study showed no learning differences between the groups, indicating that the presence of the animated Dr. Phyz character did not promote",

    "text": "student learning. Studies like this show that motion, by itself, is not enough to produce better learning outcomes. The reason for this failure is that animations like the Dr. Phyz character are basically content-free. Only animated motions that are be closely tied to the educational content will produce real learning gains. The term \u201canimation\u201d in PowerPoint presentations does not refer to the educational animations described above. Instead, PowerPoint animation usually refers to specific software features that are meant to add a dramatic quality to the presentation. Animation is commonly used for bullet point effects, such as bullet points that zoom into the screen or appear when the presenter clicks on the mouse. Some animation effects can even be used to create movement in the background of the slide, such as graphics of moving gears. Other examples of movement in powerpoint include slide transitions, such as dissolve and fade effects that are triggered when the presenter advances the presentation to a new slide. Unfortunately, these content-free forms of animation probably will not produce a positive educational impact on students, just like the Dr. Phyz example. The reason is simple: There is no educational content to be gained from a zooming bullet point. A powerpoint animation feature that has been the topic of some debate is the use of animation to make bullet points appear one-by-one at the appropriate time in the speaker\u2019s delivery, and thereby keep the speaker in control of the pace of slide information. This animation feature is variously referred to as presenting bullet points \u201con-click\u201d or the gradual build technique. The advocates for this technique cite several advantages. Cognitive psychology evidence suggests this form of animation could be beneficial because it prevents students from being overwhelmed",

    "text": "with too much information at once (Kosslyn, 2007). The on-click delivery of slide information can more closely match the speaker\u2019s verbal delivery, which prevents students from getting ahead of the speaker. Also, student survey studies suggest a preference for slides that gradually build-up bullet points over slides that introduce all of the points at once (Apperson et al., 2006; Blokzijl and Naeff, 2004; Kask, 2004). There are also some strong reasons for not using on-click animations to control the appearance of bullet points. Experiments conducted by Mahar and colleagues found that animated bullet point lists that gradually build had harmful effects on student learning (Mahar, Yaylacicegi, and  Janicki, 2009a, 2009b). Some presentation experts also oppose the practice of using animation to control the appearance of bullet points. Tufte describes this practice as \u201cthe dreaded slow reveal\u201d after which \u201cthe audience flees\u201d (Tufte, 2006, p. 6). Another presentation expert feels that the gradual building of bullet points is \u201ctiresome\u201d and \u201cpainful\u201d (Alley, 2013, pp. 146, 152). Overall, it seems that using animation to control the appearance of bullet point list items cannot be recommended, particularly because this practice may have detrimental effects on learning (Mahar et al., 2009a, 2009b). The reason for using a gradual build-up of bullet points or complex information is to prevent giving the students so much information at one time as to overwhelm their cognitive capacities. Perhaps the real problem, though, is that the slide simply holds too much information to begin with. In these situations, the use of animation to reduce cognitive overload doesn\u2019t really address the root of the problem. Dividing the excessive content of one complicated slide into",

    "text": "Visual perception enables people to estimate size and quantity. This ability is evident in young children, even before the children can count. For example, toddlers and young children are quick to point out which cookie is the largest, as any parent knows. Experimental psychologists have even found that people are able to do simple counting from just a brief glimpse of information (Mandler and Shebo, 1982). Statisticians have long appreciated this built-in perceptual ability to judge quantities and relationships. Data that is expressed in visual form like a graph can be much easier and more intuitive to comprehend than data that is listed as numbers in tables. Therefore, complex data sets are often expressed in graphs or other visual representations to promote communication and understanding (Tufte, 1990, 1997, 2001). Many people feel that making graphs is simple. Perhaps they feel this way because they have been making graphs since third or fourth grade and they regularly see graphs in the news.",

    "text": "Another reason why people view graphs as being simple is that the visual system makes the interpretation of graphs feel effortless. However, this common view that \u201cgraphs are simple\u201d is somewhat inaccurate, especially in regard to the creation of good graphs. Although statistical graphics are based on data, the effective use of graphs also depends strongly upon good design and visual perception. Unfortunately, it is easy to create graphs that confuse or even mislead people. Most people overestimate their abilities to make good graphs, so a few pointers are in order for making the most of statistical graphics. A good starting point to consider is the powerpoint medium. Most of your audience will simply not be able to see fine details in your graph. Therefore, the graphs in powerpoint presentations will need to have large, bold elements such as big columns, large text, and saturated colors. Fine details will not work well because the audience simply will not be able to see it. There is a trade-off between complexity and visibility. As the complexity increases, the visibility of the graphics will decrease, as will the value of the graphics for promoting understanding. This need for simple, bold graphs poses no problem for small data sets or basic relationships. The problem arises when data sets are large and complex. It can be difficult to make good powerpoint graphs from complex data, as noted by Tufte\u2019s scathing review of powerpoint (2006). The teacher who needs to convey complex data in a graph has some difficult choices to make. The teacher can simplify statistical graphics to fit into powerpoint, but this approach risks an oversimplification of the statistical evidence. A second possibility is to use complex statistical graphics in the powerpoint presentation, recognizing that this is done at the risk of overwhelming the",

    "text": "comprehension abilities of the audience. A third possibility, which Tufte (2006) recommends, is to put complex statistical graphics into a paper handout for the audience. Paper-based graphics have a higher resolution than powerpoint, which will help the audience understand small details or complex situations. Additionally, instructors can include supplemental or explanatory details on the paper handout without overcomplicating the information on the powerpoint slides. Once instructors address the resolution problem, they must still make a number of crucial design choices. Many graphs can be faulted for problems with the axes. For most bar or line graphs, it is best to use a Y axis (vertical) that is slightly shorter than the X axis (horizontal) because the length of vertical lines tends to be overestimated (Kosslyn, 1985). Another common Y axis problem is the scaling. The best approach is to start the scale at zero and go up. In practice, many graphs start with scales that are well above zero, which causes viewers to overestimate the magnitude of change or difference between categories. Yet another axis problem occurs when the graph maker fails to put labels on the axis. For powerpoint, doing so may not pose much of a problem during the presentation because the presenter can verbally tell the audience about the scales, although it is still advisable to label the graph\u2019s axes for the sake of clarity. The axis labels need to be present in order to make the graph work in a stand-alone document. The presence of labels on graphs might also be helpful for students who are taking notes about the slide. Powerpoint features can also tempt users into making poor design choices about their graphs. A potential problem is turning two-dimensional bar graphs or pie charts into three-",

    "text": "dimensional graphics (Mackiewicz, 2007b). The addition of a three-dimensional effect is meant to add visual interest to the graph and make it more appealing to the audience. The problem, however, is that the three-dimensional qualities of the bars or pie chart slices may create distortions that interfere with the understanding of the relationships represented by the statistical graphics. The recommendation for powerpoint graphs is to resist the temptation to turn two-dimensional statistical graphs into three-dimensional graphs (Mackiewicz, 2007b). Instructors can achieve visual interest in the graph by using cool colors (e.g., blue, green) that contrast with the background of the slide (e.g., white) rather than using unnecessary three-dimensional effects (Mackiewicz, 2007b). The recommendation to avoid unnecessary three-dimensional special effects, notably, is not universally shared by all graph perception experts. Some evidence suggests that the addition of three-dimensional effects has a minimal influence on graph comprehension (Kosslyn, 2007; Shah and Hoeffner, 2002; Zacks, Levy, Tversky, and Schiano, 1998). One of Tufte\u2019s concerns about graphs is the general tendency for presenters to feel that charts are intrinsically boring, which creates a motivation to improve the chart in some way to make it more interesting or appealing to the audience. Some presenters add unnecessary graphics to improve the visual interest of the charts and \u201cjazz it up.\u201d Tufte famously coined the term \u201cchartjunk\u201d (Tufte, 2001, p. 107) to describe this phenomenon of adding unnecessary artwork or pointless graph features, including unnecessary three- dimensional effects. His view is that chartjunk can harm the content of a statistical graphic by making readers draw the wrong conclusions or miss the main point of a relationship. Instructors",

Teachers can use Gestalt principles to indicate relationships, instructional animations to help students visualize complex changes that occur over time, and graphs that convey quantitative information in an accessible manner. Human beings are largely unaware of how they process per- ceptual information.

One study of slides from 117 presentations found that approximately two-thirds of the slides in the body of the presentation contained a bullet point list (Garner, Alley, Gaudelli, and Zappe, 2009). A similar analysis of fifty-eight presentations showed that 60.5% of the slides includ- ed bullet point lists (P\u00f6tzsch, 2007 as cited in Knoblauch, 2012).",

    "text": "The bullet point list is clearly the standard slide layout for modern presentations, a kind of cultural convention. The word \u201cpoint\u201d in \u201cpowerpoint\u201d even suggests an association with the bullet point list. The bullet point list format may have some significant drawbacks even though it is a standard used in millions of presentations. An early criticism of the bullet point list was made by Gordon Shaw and other managers at the 3M Corporation (Shaw et al., 1998). They suspected that their business plans \u201cfailed to reflect deep thought or to inspire commitment\u201d (p. 42) due to the excessive use of bullet point lists. An internal review of hundreds of 3M business plans suggested problems that originated with the bullet point list format. Bullet point items often tend to be vague goals such as \u201cincrease sales\u201d rather than specific ideas. They also found that bulleted lists often lack clarity about relationships and omitted important assumptions. Shaw and colleagues concluded that bullet point formats tend to oversimplify business plans and thereby compromise deep thought. These concerns are similar to criticisms raised by other powerpoint critics (e.g., Frommer, 2012; Tufte, 2006). We will now closely examine the bullet point list slide layout and consider some alternatives that might be more effective for educators. The teaching goal should be to use fewer bullet point lists and, when these are used, to employ them in a judicious manner. We will also examine alternative slide formats that may help educators escape the fragmentation of thought that may occur when complex ideas are converted into tiny bullet points.",

    "text": "Given all of these problems, you can see why some presentation experts have suggested completely dropping bullet point lists. Various rules have been proposed for making bullet point lists more effective. A common suggestion is 6x6 or 7x7 rules, in which the first number refers to the maximum number of bullet points per slide and the second number refers to the maximum number of words per bullet point. Other word limit recommendations include using no more than three words in each bullet point (Altman, 2012) or that the entire slide should have no more than six words (Godin, 2001). The problem with such recommendations is that these rules seem to lack a strong empirical justification (Blokzijl and Andeweg, 2005). No clear reason explains why a slide must be limited to seven bullet points that have seven words each, a fact which makes the recommended limits rather arbitrary. These rules seem to generally suggest that having a small amount of concise text tends to be more effective than having many items with lots of text (Yue et al., 2013; however, see also Blokzijl and Andeweg, 2005). Altogether, the evidence and recommendations from presentation experts encourage presenters to reduce the usage of bullet point lists. A limit of four bullet points is a good recommendation based on the limitations of visual short-term",

His work was inspired by early efforts from the field of engineering (R. Perry, 1978) and from working with graduate students at Virginia Tech and Penn State. His view is that presentations that are based upon standard powerpoint conventions like bullet point lists are often ineffective. His conclusion is that a better slide layout is needed. Alley\u2019s redesigned slide layout is called the assertion-evidence format, or sometimes the \u201cheadline style\u201d slide.

Also, students may misinterpret the slide\u2019s title to refer to Freud\u2019s own personality and not his theory of the structure of personality in general. The instructor can safely delete this title without removing any important content from the presentation. The body of the slide is also problematic. It comprises a total of six bullet points, which is probably too many. The descriptions of the key terms are short and fragmentary rather than being complete ideas. The right side of Figure 9.1 shows how the top bullet point and subpoint have been turned into an assertion-evidence slide. The first bullet point was made into an assertion statement (top) that communicates the main idea of the slide in a complete sentence. This statement communicates the more complete thought that the bullet points were based upon. To make room for this assertion sentence, we had to move the title field up and stretch it horizontally, as well as reducing the size of the font. The increased title space provided some freedom to add new information about the id from the subpoint. The evidence part of the slide (bottom) is an iceberg image based on Freud\u2019s analogy that the personality structure is like an iceberg. Immediately, we can see that this slide is highly attractive and visually interesting compared to the basic bullet point layout, even though the slide formatting is a very simple black text on white. Students may be intrigued by this image\u2014Why is there an iceberg on this slide?\u2014and this intrigue may help to increase student engagement. With this slide, the instructor can discuss the basic characteristics of the id, and then segue nicely into Freud\u2019s analogy to illustrate how the id relates to consciousness.

    "text": "are analogous to the small and limited conscious mind, but the larger and more powerful below-water parts of the iceberg are like the unconscious mind.) Note how the iceberg graphic will support and complement the assertion made at the top of the slide. The iceberg image, with labels in the appropriate places, will help the instructor explain this famous analogy to the students. The labels on this slide have been formatted for high contrast (white text on dark backgrounds and vice versa) to facilitate reading. The image gives the instructor something interesting and memorable to discuss with the students. Altogether, the assertion-evidence slide is much more information rich than the bullet point formatted slide, with more details about one bullet point item. This new information is not overwhelming though, at least partly because some of the information is presented as an image rather than text. The assertion-evidence slide is less likely to overload students because it contains less text than the bullet point formatted slide: fifteen words vs. twenty-one words, respectively. We also need to consider the information omitted from the assertion-evidence slide. We removed the title from the slide with the bullet point layout because it was unimportant, redundant, and ambiguous. We can eliminate the subpoints of how each part of the personality relates to consciousness by working this information into the assertion sentences. This change makes it more cohesive. Finally, fancy colors and slide design graphics were eliminated to decrease potential distractions. The instructional graphic generates sufficient visual interest. The lack of extraneous information from unnecessary colors and decorations makes the students be more focused and avoids a short-term memory burden.",

    "text": "The assertion-evidence slide in Figure 9.1 also left out the bullet point information about the other personality parts (ego and superego). The information from the second and third bullet points of the standard slide can become headlines for two new slides with the assertion-evidence layout. The coverage of one point per slide will help keep the class focused on the part under discussion (the id in this example) and thus keep the pace of the lecture on track. Students have no opportunity to be distracted by getting ahead of the teacher. In this example, the students will not be writing down information about the ego (main bullet point #2) and superego (point #3) while the teacher is still discussing the id (point #1). Presenting one idea on a slide in this manner will help to avoid information overload. A second example of an assertion-evidence formatted slide appears in Figure 9.2. In this example, the key idea\u2014an increasing autism diagnosis rate\u2014is clearly stated for the students at the top of the slide. This assertion is supported by a graph based on data from the Centers for Disease Control. The graphic helps the speaker make an important point about the degree of change. The use of a colored arrow directs attention towards the most critical part of the graph. The upward direction of the arrow accentuates the increase and makes understanding the graph more intuitive for the audience. Another positive feature is that the graphic is more visually appealing and interesting than bullet points. It might even be interesting enough to become a common point of discussion between the speaker and the audience. Finally, note how the slide formatting is very plain in order to focus everyone\u2019s attention on the message.",

In contrast, the use of text, including bullet point lists, should be avoided or minimized. Using images in this space will have a greater impact on the audience than presenting more words. This evidence area also gives teachers the opportunity to pair visual images with text statements and achieve the synergistic benefits of multimedia learning. Although the use of text in the evidence area is generally discouraged, strategically placed key words in this part of the slide can be helpful guides that highlight important features. For example, complex diagrams may need labels that serve as orienting cues for the important elements of the visual evidence. It\u2019s worth noting that the assertion-evidence layout was developed to specifically meet the needs of science and engineering instruction. The evidence used in these STEM disciplines has a mostly visual basis. In contrast, faculty members who teach English and foreign language courses have informed me that text rather than images would be the subject matter for the evidence part of their slides. It seems likely that the assertion-evidence format could be successfully adapted to language-focused courses. In these situations, the assertion statement would, for example, convey a writing principle to the students. The evidence part of the slide would be examples of sentences that illustrate the principle from the assertion statement. The instructor would use these example sentences from the evidence part of the slide to support the discussion of the writing principle. It might be a good practice in these situations to provide students with a brief period of time to silently read through the example sentences in order to",

    "text": "reduce the possibility of cognitive overload. This suggested use of assertion-evidence in the humanities would need further research to determine if it is an effective approach. The assertion-evidence format has numerous advantages. One benefit for the speaker is increased focus. The process of summarizing the main idea of the slide in the assertion forces the speaker to fully develop the key components of the message. A second benefit is that the assertion-evidence style allows the presenter to make a clearer statement about the thesis of the slide. The audience benefits from the assertion because important assumptions and relationships can be expressed more clearly in a single sentence than several bullet point list items. Although writing an assertion as a full sentence might seem rather wordy, the assertion-evidence slide layout tends to have less text overall than slides with the standard bullet point list. An assertion-evidence slide has more space for visual images compared to a standard slide that has a title, bullet points, and a graphic area. Making the images larger improves the visibility of the graphics and increases the overall emotional impact that the slide might have on the audience. These changes improve the effectiveness of both the text and the image information. A variation on the assertion-evidence format that may be especially useful for teaching is the evidence-assertion sequence (Alley, 2013). The first slide in the evidence-assertion sequence poses a question, in headline format, along with visual evidence. The visual evidence might be a graph, table, or other graphic display of information. The instructor asks the students to answer the question posed in the slide headline by using the visual evidence provided in the slide. This question leads to a dialogue",

The second slide in the sequence contains the answer, in the headline format again, along with the same visual evidence, thereby providing closure to the question posed in the first slide of the sequence. This clever approach increases active learning and student engagement. Given the strengths of the assertion-evidence slide format, slides using this format should result in better learning and higher test scores than slides containing standard bullet point lists. Positive evidence supports their educational effectiveness. A pioneering study evaluated the educational impact of assertion- evidence slides by comparing these to standard powerpoint slides in an undergraduate Geology class (Alley, Schreiber, and Muffo, 2005). The students who received the assertion-evidence style slides performed better on select multiple-choice final exam questions (82% correct) compared to students from previous semesters who received the standard powerpoint format (71% correct). In addition, student attitudes towards the assertion- evidence slide format were positive, with the assertion-evidence style slides being preferred by a greater than seven to one ratio. Subsequent studies by Alley and colleagues replicated these findings of better exam performance with the assertion-evidence formatted slides (Alley, Schreiber, Ramsdell, and  Muffo, 2006; Diesel, Alley, Schreiber, and Borrego, 2006; Garner and Alley, 2013; Wolfe, Alley, and Sheridan, 2006). A number of reasons explain why the assertion-evidence slide layout is superior to the typical bullet point list layout.

A sentence headline can clearly communicate and organize key ideas better than a short phrase title, which is an example of the signaling principle of multimedia learning (C. Atkinson and Mayer, 2004). Headlines may also help because the key idea of the slide is not mixed together with bullet list items of varying importance in the body of the slide (Alley et al., 2006). The assertion-evidence layout guidelines also recommend reducing the overall amount of text on the slide (consistent with the modality principle of multimedia learning) and eliminating unnecessary slide features (consistent with the coherence principle), both of which are beneficial practices. Finally, the assertion-evidence structure, in its essence, reflects scientific thinking. The assertion sentence is similar to a hypothesis. The evidence part of the slide resembles the results of an experiment. These two elements combine in a meaningful way to make each assertion-evidence slide a miniature example of the scientific method (ideas and supporting evidence). In this manner, the assertion-evidence format might engage deeper thinking processes than the usual bullet point list slide layout. The assertion-evidence format has a great deal of promise for educators. Unfortunately, the educational effectiveness of the assertion-evidence slide format has received little attention outside of the field of engineering. We clearly need more research evidence to fully establish the educational effectiveness of the assertion-evidence slide format, especially in disciplines other than the natural sciences and engineering.",

In contrast, assertion statements are based on complete ideas rather than sentence fragments. This general assertion-evidence idea, that the titles should be complete thoughts, may be useful for slide layouts that use bullet point lists. Consider the following example in Figure 9.3 which has a sentence structure that is left unfinished. The bullet items effectively complete the thought started in the assertion. In this way, the combination of assertion and completing bullet points makes the slide into a series of three coherent ideas. Another variation on this idea is that the sentence in the assertion could be a question with a blank in place of a key term, and the bullet point items could be the potential solutions. This would make the slide into a multiple-choice question, which could benefit assessing student comprehension.",

This raises an interesting possibility: How far could we go in eliminating text? Would it be worthwhile to completely eliminate all of the text and just use instructional images? Research on multimedia learning has investigated the role of on-screen text in educational materials and provides some informative answers. A consistent finding from research studies is that on-screen text that duplicates the information provided by narration leads to lower scores on tests that involve higher-order thinking skills. These findings form the basis of the redundancy principle: \u201cPeople learn more deeply from graphics and narration than from graphics, narration, and printed text\u201d (Mayer, 2009; see also Sweller et al., 1998). Another form of redundancy can occur in situations that have two forms of word-based information, such as narration plus written words, presented at the same time without instructional graphics (Moreno and Mayer, 2002).",

    "text": "The problem posed by redundancy\u2014the same words presented by both narration and visual text\u2014bears a striking resemblance to a typical powerpoint presentation. In many powerpoint presentations, the speaker provides the audience with the same words through vision (on-screen) and hearing (spoken) at the same time. Therefore, the standard powerpoint presentation closely resembles the redundancy situation studied in the lab. Applying the redundancy principle to powerpoint presentations suggests that the best format might be to use powerpoint primarily for showing instructional graphics. Text should be used sparingly, possibly as cues for important points, or not at all. In other words, a good instructional slide could focus entirely on instructional images (no text) with the explanatory words coming entirely from the teacher\u2019s voice. The idea of using slides that emphasize instructional graphics also has support from presentation experts who recommend using full-screen graphics and as little text as possible. The presentation design books Presentation Zen (Reynolds, 2008) and Slide:ology (Duarte, 2008) contain many examples of presentation slides that are predominantly images with little-to-no text. These large images support the speaker\u2019s main points but do not overwhelm the audience with unnecessary on-screen text. Alley calls the full- screen graphic slide the \u201cTED slide structure\u201d after the popular educational video series. It is characterized by \u201cfew words (if any) and powerful images that often fill the screen\u201d (Alley, 2013, p. 184). This format might be particularly useful when scientific experts communicate their research findings to the general public. Only a few studies have scientifically tested the educational effectiveness of emphasizing images over words in slide content.",

    "text": "One study examined the educational effects of slides that had short sentences integrated with evocative images (Johnson & Christensen, 2011). The study compared students who received the \u201csimplified-visually rich\u201d (p. 294) slides to students who received a standard bullet point format. Student interest was increased for the simplified-visually rich format slides, but their performance on examinations was the same as students in a condition that received the standard bullet point list format. Another study compared a group of students who received a standard powerpoint presentation (bullet point lists) to students who received powerpoint slide graphics that varied in the degree of relevance to the topic (Tangen et al., 2011). Students who received the presentations with images had higher interest in the topic than students in the text condition, suggesting that students prefer images over bullet points. Not surprisingly, student performance was lowest in the conditions with the least relevant graphical images. These studies show that images are an effective way of increasing student interest in a topic, but, again, the images must be highly relevant to the educational content in order to promote learning. Images that are evocative yet irrelevant may be ineffective or possibly even harmful due to producing distractions or seductive detail effects. One research study has investigated the educational outcomes of replacing bullet point lists entirely with relevant instructional graphics. Holstead compared course sections taught with the standard powerpoint slide formats (i.e., bullet point lists and instructional graphics) to other sections of the course taught with slides containing only instructional graphics ( i.e., no bullet point lists; Holstead, 2015). The student performance on exams was the same for the first two exams, but the graphics-only sections",

    "text": "did better than the standard powerpoint sections on the final exam. Student feedback in the graphics-only course was more positive than the standard powerpoint condition in regards to \u201cgeneral intellectual development, instructor-student relationship, importance and relevance, and overall perceptions of the course\u201d (p. 345). In addition, students in the graphics-only sections found the course to be easier and reported paying more attention due to the slide format. The instructor also felt that the flow and pacing of the lecture were improved with the graphics-only slides. There were, for example, no requests to go back to the previous slide because someone was struggling to write down all the text. These results show that the elimination of bullet point lists seemed to produce a neutral to weakly beneficial effect on exam scores, and a positive benefit on student perceptions of the lectures. Intriguingly, student performance was not harmed by the complete elimination of bullet point lists. The findings of the Holstead study are consistent with laboratory findings on multimedia learning. The student feedback that the course was \u201ceasier\u201d without bullet point lists may indicate that they experienced less of a short-term memory cognitive load. Students might find it easier to pay attention to the instructor\u2019s voice when they face no bullet point list to copy down. In addition, the absence of a bullet point list in Holstead\u2019s (2015) study may have promoted active learning. The increased student need for active engagement with the teacher may have occurred, in part, because the students were not provided with online access to the powerpoint file or some other form of instructor notes. The student note-taking effort was entirely dependent upon listening closely to the instructor and developing a personal understanding of the key points for note-taking.",

    "text": "The use of images may also have beneficial effects for promoting student-teacher interactions. Class discussion can be improved when the slides emphasize instructional images or assertion- evidence slides with large images (Kahn, 2007; Maxwell, 2007). These increased student-teacher interactions might occur because the image projected on the screen can become a common point of discussion between the presenter and the audience (Knoblauch, 2012). This evidence suggests that instructional images might be more effective than bullet point list items for promoting classroom discussion. Possible explanations for this might be increased emotion from images or possibly because the students are not preoccupied with writing down all of the text in their notes. Further research will be necessary to explore these possibilities. Surveys of student opinions about powerpoint features also suggest a preference for less text (Apperson et al., 2006). The best teaching styles in one study were associated with using a wide range of features in their powerpoint slide decks, including photos, charts, graphics, sound, and animation (Brock and Joglekar, 2011). Their recommendation for teachers was to use slides that are light in text (three bullet points or twenty words per slide) and to add visual elements to text slides (Brock and Joglekar, 2011). In summary, the research findings suggest interesting possibilities for the role of instructional graphics. Slides that focus on educational images rather than bullet points stimulate a higher degree of student interest. Again, these images must be highly relevant instructional graphics that support the verbal message from the instructor. The effects of these image-focused slides on student achievement, however, must be cautiously interpreted as neutral to slightly beneficial. Still, these preliminary findings are",

    "text": "The typical bullet point list layouts of powerpoint slides have guided millions of slide presentations. Although the bullet point format is a widely used standard, the evidence suggests that the slides produced with this layout are weak and ineffective presentation aids. These presentations may have a slick, professional look with the bullet points and accompanying decorations, but at their heart bullet points often lack the intellectual substance that the presenter and audience desperately need. Alley urges presenters to go beyond the common use of bullet point lists and other standard powerpoint approaches. His view is nicely captured in this short phrase about the default values of powerpoint, such as bullet point lists: \u201cWe can do better.\u201d (Gilbert, 2015). Like Alley suggests, teachers should aim to do better by avoiding the overuse of bullet point lists, a practice that seems to be a common cause of presentation mediocrity. From this review, we can generally conclude that relevant instructional images, such as diagrams, charts, and pictures, that support the instructional message may have a stronger educational benefit than a multitude of bullet points lists. There are several advantages. Instructional images can convey a higher degree of information to an audience than written text without causing a cognitive overload problem.

The use of images also promotes more student engagement than a bullet point list format. A good starting point for improvement is to decrease the text and number of bullet points on slides, aiming for a maximum of four bullet points per slide and keeping the text of these bullet points limited to short phrases. After this initial effort, the next step is to convert bullet point list items into separate slides in an assertion-evidence format or a graphic-only format. Perhaps it would be enough to simply sprinkle a few graphics-only slides between existing bullet point slides. Switching to assertion- evidence formatted slides can be difficult at first, but this extra effort is well worth the time and energy. Students will experience this method of teaching as being effortless and even fun compared to the usual endless lists that they typically receive.",

In spite of this early insight, attention was not scientifically studied for many decades because psychologists thought that attention was too vague and slippery to be the subject of scientific study. Fortunately, the last several decades have seen an increased interest in scientific research on attention. The phenomenon of attention is much better understood now, even though it still remains a somewhat elusive subject. An important discovery made by modern attention research is that attention is not just a single, unitary process. What we broadly call \u201cattention\u201d in everyday life is actually made of several separate processes that complement each other. We can break attention down into an earlier process (orienting) and later processes (selective, sustained). Examining each of these processes and considering practical ways teachers might use these different aspects of attention will help facilitate teaching and learning.",

    "text": "Attention begins by noticing the things and events that are happening around us. We are almost magnetically drawn to sensory changes produced by moving objects and loud noises. These dynamic sensory changes alert us to something interesting that is occurring in our environment. Certain brain regions are specifically wired to direct our attention to whatever might be changing in our environment. This early and basic form of attention is called the orienting reflex. A good example of the orienting reflex is how the flashing lights, bold colors, and loud sirens of an ambulance can grab our attention. These dramatic features alert us to an important situation. A downside to having an orienting reflex is that people can be easily distracted by any sudden sensory change. A classroom example of the orienting reflex occurs when students arrive late to class. It seems like the eyeballs of the classroom are automatically drawn to look at the latecomer, taking attention away from the teacher. The same problem occurs during studying when distractions like television, phones, and ambient noise capture attention and leave fewer mental resources available for doing coursework. There are growing concerns that people are not very capable of managing the continuous interruptions produced by modern technology (Gazzaley and Rosen, 2016; M. Jackson, 2008). Minimizing distractions, whenever possible, is a good strategy for educators to follow because distractions can be an enemy of the learning process. The experienced teacher is aware of the orienting reflex and uses it to their advantage to promote learning. Have you ever",

    "text": "taken a course from a professor who drones on and on in a boring monotone voice? The stereotypical boring professor might also have little motion, and stay fixed in one place behind the lecture podium. It\u2019s unnatural for people to maintain their focus on an unchanging, never-moving object. Students can pay attention to an unchanging presentation delivery for a brief time, but it becomes progressively harder and harder to maintain the focus, which leads to daydreaming, phone fiddling, and other distractions. The solution is for the teacher to use some sensory changes in the delivery to engage the orienting reflex. Varying the volume and tone of voice makes the verbal dimension of the presentation more dramatic and easier to listen to. For vision, it helps for the teacher to get away from the podium and move about the room. The orientation reflex will cause students to follow the variations in your voice and track your movements around the room. These small variations will trigger the orienting reflex and make your presentation more engaging. Powerpoint presentations can direct attention via the orienting reflex in a number of ways. One of the most basic ways is the slide transition. Switching to a new slide can alert students to a change and draw attention. Likewise, highlighting an important part of a slide in a dramatic color that is different from the rest of the slide draws student attention to the highlighted area. Colored circles or arrows that stand out can highlight an important part of a figure or graph. Laser pointers can also usefully provide both color and motion to point out an important feature in the presentation. It has been suggested that today\u2019s students, who have been raised with visual stimulation from many sources, will respond positively to having lots of visual stimulation in their education. If this is true, perhaps it would be advantageous to put as many",

The potential problem with this idea, of course, is overdoing it. People tend to shut down or direct their attention away if there is too much stimulation. Excessive motion and other sensory stimulation can also make a presentation look amateurish and unprofessional. The best approach is to use motion and auditory changes in moderation because too little stimulation is undesirable, but too much stimulation is also undesirable. This suggestion matches with the Yerkes-Dodson law from psychology: Increasing arousal improves performance up to a point, but further increases in arousal may actually produce declines in performance (Yerkes and Dodson, 1908). Attention is a valuable resource, so instructors must take care to not overwhelm the students with content-free sensory stimulation.",

Selective attention occurs when the brain narrows sensory input down to concentrate on the information that is most important. Selective attention works through subtraction. Most of the incoming sensory information is actively ignored so that one particularly important matter can be examined in great detail, as William James described in his famous passage. This limitation reflects a judicious trade-off in processing. The brain can only think deeply about a single thing at any given moment, so unimportant information must be discarded.",

    "text": "A number of analogies have been used to describe the focused and limited nature of selective attention. A popular analogy is to liken selective attention to a filter. Most of the sensory information gets trapped in the filter and receives little to no processing. A small amount of important information is selected to pass through the filter and on to consciousness for deeper processing. Another common analogy for selective attention is to liken attention to a spotlight in a theater. Imagine a play being performed on a large theater stage. When a spotlight shines on the main character, we see this character and the nearby parts of the stage in great detail. The highlighted features are prominent and stand-out from the rest of the stage. In contrast, the darker areas of the stage that are outside of the spotlight recede. Activities in the areas outside of the spotlight may go completely unnoticed. The spotlight serves to focus and thereby enhance our attention on one point of the stage, but this increased focus comes at the expense of ignoring events that are occurring on the other parts of the stage. Both analogies feature the essential aspect of the limiting nature of attention. People possess a very narrow capacity to deeply process sensory information. Deep thought is limited to about one topic at any given moment. Selective attention describes what most educators are thinking about when they ask a class to \u201cpay attention.\u201d In classroom settings, we would hope that the teacher and educationally relevant activities would be the focal point of attention. Students must filter out less important information in order to properly focus on the lesson. Interestingly, the phrase \u201cpaying attention\u201d implies that attention is like money. Attention, just like money, is a limited resource. Like money, attention must be spent wisely.",

    "text": "The limited capacity of selective attention suggests that an audience has a limited ability to process the amount of information on a powerpoint slide. We\u2019ve seen that the most common student complaint about powerpoint presentations is that too much information is presented. This problem occurs because the limitations of selective attention can make it easy to overwhelm the audience with too much information. The obvious solution to this problem is to reduce or limit the amount of information on the slides. The more effective approach for slides that have numerous bullet points, including multiple levels of organization, would be to split the information over several slides with only a few bullet points on each slide. In addition, it is generally recommended that each bullet point item should be kept short, such as one-to-three words in length, rather than being lengthy sentences (Altman, 2012). Powerpoint presentations can also overwhelm selective attention if the pace of information delivery is too fast. Powerpoint makes it easy for the teacher to simply click through the slide deck without giving students enough time to comprehend the information, leading to information overload. The solution to this situation is to be mindful of how much information students can learn from a powerpoint presentation. Teachers must watch carefully to see how students are reacting to the pace of the presentation and be prepared to slow down if needed.",

A common classroom example occurs when students attempt to take notes and respond to cell phone text messages at the same time. This splitting of attention between two tasks leads to lower performance on both tasks, but doing poorly on the note-taking task is our primary concern. Although it\u2019s called divided attention, this term is a little bit misleading because selective attention cannot be truly divided. Divided attention really involves rapidly switching back and forth between two different tasks that require attention resources. For example, a student who attempts to take notes and keep up with phone text messages at that same time is not really doing both activities simultaneously. Instead, they are really switching back and forth very quickly between tasks. When they focus their mind on the cell phone, they filter out all other information, including the lecture or class activities, so their learning drops from little to none at all. Since attention is a limited resource, limiting distractions of all sorts beneficially minimizes the potential problem of divided attention. Several aspects of educational presentations might involve divided attention problems. One divided attention situation occurs when the spoken part of the lecture is accompanied by a visual slide presentation. This situation gives the students two competing sources of information: auditory and visual. Which one does the student attend to and learn from? Having multiple elements together on a slide may also possibly create a divided attention problem.

A third problem is that students may focus their attention on slide features that are emotionally vivid\u2014pretty pictures\u2014yet light in instructional content. A fourth possible problem is that note-taking creates a divided attention situation. Students are not attending to the current verbal information when they are composing a sentence in their notes. Only after the student finishes composing the sentence does their attention become free for redirection back to the lecture message. Given this limited nature of attention, the teaching mission is best served by eliminating as many competing elements as possible in order to help students focus on the most essential components of the presentation. This idea is supported by multimedia learning research findings that providing unnecessary information can decrease student learning (Mayer, 2009; see also Chapter 11). A good starting point is to eliminate or minimize classroom distractions frequently recognized as potential problems, such as loud noises, student conversations, and electronic distractions like cell phones. These distractions may interfere with instruction due to both the orienting reflex and divided attention problems. Next, a clean presentation design that eliminates or minimizes unnecessary features\u2014extraneous colors, logos, and cutesy pictures\u2014will also help direct attention towards the important parts of the presentation. Digital technologies like powerpoint sometimes make it too easy to keep adding features. The best teachers, however, know when to apply restraint to keep inessential embellishments from obscuring the main message.

This component is the ability to hold and maintain attention over extended periods of time. An example of sustained attention is the task faced by a hunter in the woods. The hunter must stay still and be vigilant while waiting for game animals, sometimes for hours at a stretch. The hunter must focus on watching for game animals so that nothing will be missed. Unfortunately, maintaining attention over long periods of time can be difficult to do. Boredom creeps into the task, and the mind wanders away from its intended purpose.

    "text": "off after about twenty to thirty minutes of lecturing. The evidence behind this statistic comes primarily from studies of educational television programming in the 1960s, which was a hot research topic at that time. For example, one study found a considerable drop in the number of students paying attention to educational television shows over the course of thirty minutes (Bridges, 1960). In a similar fashion, 84% of surveyed college juniors reported that \u201c. . .20-30 minutes was the maximum amount of time during which they could tolerate uninterrupted lecturing and note-taking during a lecture period.\u201d (MacManaway, 1970, p. 322). Other research has suggested that the drop-off in attention occurs in as little as ten minutes (Hartley & Davies, 1978; Medina, 2008), although the quickness of this decline is somewhat uncertain (K. Wilson & Korn, 2007). A fast drop-off in attention is plausibly due, at least in part, to the sophisticated multimedia exposure of today\u2019s students. On YouTube, the most popular videos from 2014 had an average length of four minutes and twenty seconds (\u201cThe best video length for different videos on YouTube\u201d). Class lectures that go on for over an hour may seem quite dull compared to the latest viral video clips. In some respects, the exact time point when students begin to lose interest in a lecture doesn\u2019t matter. Teachers can safely assume that the drop-off in student attention occurs fairly quickly and declines progressively throughout the course of the lecture. The sustained attention problem brings up two important questions about lecturing during classes. First, is lecturing a valid teaching approach given this dramatic drop-off in attention? It seems like lectures could be completely futile if attention declines so rapidly. Second, what can teachers do to counteract this lost attention?",

    "text": "In the influential book What\u2019s the Use of Lectures? , Donald Bligh suggests that lecturing is still an appropriate teaching method even though student attention may drop off dramatically during the course of a lecture (Bligh, 2000). The lecture approach particularly excels at the transmission of information, so lecturing is worthwhile to educators for this purpose. Bligh proposes that the key to successful lectures is to plan for a decline in attention by alternating lecturing with other teaching approaches. The students need periodic lecture breaks that switch away from lecturing to other teaching-related activities. These other approaches tend to engage emotions and interest, and thereby keep the students emotionally involved. After these break points, lecturing can resume for a short while and then be followed by another educational strategy switch to maintain student interest. The successful teacher is, in some ways, like a juggler who must constantly switch between various educational approaches during the class period in order to maintain student interest. A similar recommendation is made by John Medina, who is a neurobiologist and the author of Brain Rules (2008). Medina\u2019s successful lecture organization is centered upon the limited ability of students to sustain attention through a lecture (p. 89\u201492). The class period starts with an overview that outlines the topic for the day. After this introduction, class time is divided into 10-minute modules based upon evidence that the ability to pay sustained attention to the topic fades at about the 10-minute mark (Hartley and Davies, 1978). Each 10-minute module presents one main idea, the \u201cgist\u201d of a topic, that can be explained in one minute. The following nine minutes in the module contain details about the key idea that provide supporting evidence and clearly relate to the",

    "text": "main idea. When the ten-minute module is complete, declining student attention is recaptured and boosted by presenting emotional hooks that are based upon case histories, anecdotes, narratives, and possibly even humorous material. It is important for these emotional breaks between modules to be relevant to the preceding modules to avoid the possibility of seeming \u201cdisjointed\u201d or \u201cpatronizing\u201d. In other words, an off-topic joke is not desirable. An interesting example or anecdote that illustrates the lecture topic in an entertaining way is the goal. The emotional break is then followed by another ten minute module of educational content to start a new cycle. Throughout the class there are periodic reminders of the progress through the topics of the day to help keep students oriented in regard to how each module relates to the overall picture for the class. This pattern of regular switching from lecturing about course content to emotional hooks and then back again to course content helps to maintain a high level of student interest throughout the entire class period. This teaching method has not been explicitly tested, but it is based on research evidence and is also consistent with Bligh\u2019s recommendation for switching strategies during a lecture. Medina credits this \u201cbrain rule\u201d understanding of human attention for his teaching success. Powerpoint can help instructors follow this lecture-break- lecture-break pattern. Instructors can design powerpoint slide decks with regular break points in the lecture to avoid the monotony of a never-ending stream of facts. For example, the instructor could include a slide with a prompt that asks the students if they have any questions. Sometimes the instructor can dramatically illustrate key concepts with short video clips embedded in the powerpoint presentation. These video examples",

The model likens the human mind to a computer: information is entered, processed, and then stored for later use. The model proposes that long-term memory is gradually formed through three stages of processing. The first stage is sensory memory, which is a one- to two-second impression of sensory information. The second stage is short-term memory. This stage holds information for up to twenty seconds, a period just long enough to do something productive with the information. The capacity of short-term memory is very limited, with the classical description being 7\u00b12 items of information (see also Baddeley, 1986; Baddeley, Thomson, and Buchanan, 1975). These first two stages of the model prepare information for the last stage, which is long-term memory storage. As the information passes through these stages, a selective process takes place that eliminates the less important information. Vast amounts of sensory information enter the system, but relatively little information\u2014only what is attended to\u2014is eventually stored in long-term memory. The degree of data loss is huge. It has been estimated that each eye collects about 3,900 megabytes of information every second, which is enough information to fill six compact disks (Snowden, Thompson, and Troscianko, 2012). Most of this information never makes it past short-term",

    "text": "memory. The vast majority of data is lost going from the earliest stages (megabytes) to the second stage (about seven items). This huge information loss may seem problematic, but it is, in fact, an important feature. The purpose of forgetting massive amounts of information is to prevent long-term memory from becoming filled up with unimportant details. Cognitive scientists in the field of education have focused on the small capacity of short-term memory (sometimes called working memory) as being a key limiting factor for student learning (Baddeley, 1986; Paivio, 1990; Penney, 1989). Cognitive load theory proposes that the learning process places demands on the information processing capacity of students. When there is too much information, the limited cognitive capacity of short- term memory is exceeded and learning declines. Either the audience can be overwhelmed with too much information or the information may be presented in a manner that places too many demands on short-term memory. Cognitive load research in education has, in general, focused on finding teaching strategies that improve student learning by reducing the cognitive load on short-term memory. At this point, it is worth noting that the key idea of limited cognitive capacity from memory research is quite similar to the research on attention described earlier. Both attention and short-term memory research suggest a very limited capacity in the human mind that can be easily overwhelmed by too much information. This evidence for limited attention and limited short-term memory capacity needs to be a guiding principle for the design of powerpoint presentations. The most effective educators aim to stimulate the minds of their students while",

This change improved instruction by giving words a visual presence. It seems likely that chalkboards facilitated education, at least in part, by relieving a short-term memory limitation that students commonly face.

    "text": "the ability to process information by providing an external aid that reduces cognitive load. Critics may be tempted to view powerpoint as being just an electronic version of chalkboard technology: a high-tech word delivery device. In fact, many educators held this attitude when powerpoint was introduced years ago, dismissing the then-new powerpoint technology as unnecessary. This view, however, errors by being too narrow. Just like great food combinations, the combination of visual and verbal information in a powerpoint presentation results in something more than the mere sum of the parts. Education has traditionally relied upon text to convey important ideas. With powerpoint, there is the opportunity to transcend the limitations of the written word by combining text with other rich sources of information. Seeing the topic material affords the students a more direct connection with the topic through images and video. This more immediate connection might facilitate student engagement much more than a chalkboard. The support of text with other visual information may also tap into deeper learning processes and thereby aid the teaching process. The educational media used in today\u2019s classrooms has an information richness unimaginable in the 1800s due to the wide availability of pictures, diagrams, graphs, animations, and videos. This approach\u2014words plus images\u2014has been called a multimedia- based approach (Mayer, 2009). Multimedia educational research has compared the comprehension of text passages with or without the presence of visual images. The findings of these studies consistently show that combining words with visual information, such as instructional graphics, can have a beneficial effect on student learning from textbooks (Carney and Levin, 2002; J. R.",

    "text": "Levin, 1981; J. R. Levin, Anglin, and Carney, 1987). Later studies documented the positive effects of combining spoken words with animations and other high-tech visual media (Mayer, 2009). The complementary effects of visual and verbal information are the same regardless of the medium used to deliver this information to the students. This idea, which is variously called dual-coding theory or multimedia learning, is that visual and auditory information might work together in a complementary way to promote learning (Mayer, 2009; Paivio, 1990). A number of ideas have been proposed to explain why using visual information plus spoken words promotes student learning. One explanation is that this improvement could occur because short-term memory uses separate brain areas for vision and hearing. These two separate channels of information processing might work together in a synergistic fashion (Horvath, 2014). A second possibility is that pictures themselves contain information and that this information richness might help overcome the limitations of short-term memory. Evidence suggests that information from visual aids may be processed more efficiently than text. Some studies also suggest that images such as diagrams may help students create mental representations of complex information (Glenberg and Langston, 1992; Mayer, 1989). Yet another possibility is that images help the learning process by directing attention or promoting information integration in ways that facilitate learning. The beneficial effects of pairing words with pictures may depend on all of these processes to some degree and may vary depending on the teaching situation. Although combining words and images is positive, the research is very consistent in showing that not just any image will",

    "text": "promote student learning. One test of this idea used eye-tracking technology to determine which parts of a slide received the most visual attention during a presentation (Slykhuis, Wiebe, and Annetta, 2005). The images that matched the slide instructional content received the most viewing time. In contrast, decorative images were viewed for much less time. These results show that students strategically allocate their mental resources in ways that will promote learning, such as close examination of images that provide some form of useful content. Several image types are beneficial for learning. Carney and Levin (2002) describe and categorize some typical roles for pictures presented in context with text. Organizational images provide a framework for understanding the text content. For example, news stories about a particular region often include a map to help readers understand the geographical location of the news story. Node-link diagrams, such as organizational charts, also provide a visual representation of the organization and relationship between different elements (Dansereau and Simpson, 2009). Interpretational images such as diagrams, graphs, and instructional animations help the reader understand the text content by illustrating how complex systems work (Mayer and Gallini, 1990; Mayer and Moreno, 1998). Finally, transformation images contain memory aids like mnemonic devices that assist in the memorization of important points from the text. Powerpoint seems like an ideal medium for multimedia instruction because it can display visual images to an audience in a way that can augment or complement the verbal message. This ability should allow educators to reach students in both an auditory and visual manner, which combine to facilitate learning.",

In their research studies, students learned about science or engineering topics from instructional passages that were accompanied by visual images or animated instructional graphics. The typical experiment was to compare students who had text accompanied by images (experimental group) to students who had just text (control group). Variations on this basic experimental approach were used to address a wide range of questions about the learning conditions that would promote or hinder learning. For example, would students learn more from an animation with narration alone or an instructional animation that has both narration and on-screen text? Would more learning occur with background music? Would students learn more if the subject content was accompanied by interesting stories? From these studies, a number of general principles were developed to guide instructional design (Mayer, 2009). These practical principles can be applied to make powerpoint presentations provide more effective education.",

Research from Mayer and other investigators tested this idea by comparing the performance of people who receive only narrative instruction to students who receive both narrative and image-based information. The combination of words and images produces superior performance in both recall and higher-order learning of the material. This superior learning is most likely to occur for topics that have a strong visualization component, such as scientific topics. The research findings that support multimedia learning are robust, with supporting evidence from studies of reading comprehension (for reviews, see Carney and Levin, 2002; Filippatou and Pumfrey, 1996; Levie and Lentz, 1982) and computer-based instruction (Mayer, 2009).

    "text": "possibility, a number of studies by Mayer (Mayer et al., 2001; Moreno and Mayer, 2002) and other researchers (for reviews, see Sweller et al., 1998; van Merri\u00ebnboer and Sweller, 2005) compared learning situations that had an instructional graphic plus narrative instruction to other learning situations that had instructional graphics, narration, and on-screen text. The results of these studies consistently show that students perform better when a graphical image is accompanied by narration without on-screen text. In short, providing the same words in both visual and auditory form hinders learning because providing too much information at one time creates a cognitive load problem. The redundancy principle explains why the common pre- sentation practice of reading a speech from a projected slide is problematic. The students in this situation receive a repetitious double-dose of the verbal message to the auditory and visual systems, which results in overloading short-term memory capac- ity. The redundancy principle suggests that educators would be better off by having a visual graphic plus narration accompanied by minimal or no on-screen text (see Chapter 9). The redundancy principle is not meant to suggest that all of the text should be eliminated from a powerpoint slide. The typical source of the redundancy problem is displaying an excessive amount of text to the learner. The redundancy problem occurs in the laboratory when the entire narration and on-screen text are identical. Most powerpoint presentations, in contrast, only show brief bullet point items and do not follow this problematic pattern of excessive on-screen text. Some research shows that having brief phrases displayed to the students is beneficial. In particular, short word cues like captions that are strategically placed on a displayed",

    "text": "It seems very intuitive that adding human interest stories to educational content might assist instruction by increasing the students\u2019 emotional involvement. Although stories can be engaging, they sometimes have detrimental effects on learning when the stories have little relevance to understanding the topic. The research term for this phenomenon is seductive details: interesting yet irrelevant information producing harmful effects on learning. This seductive detail problem occurs because unimportant information consumes precious short-term memory resources, thereby leaving less cognitive capacity available in short-term memory for the important ideas (Mayer, 2009). The elimination of seductive details in some studies has helped to improve student learning (Mayer et al., 2001). It might seem like the harmful potential of seductive details contradicts suggestions about the importance of emotions and stories from Chapter 5 and 6, but this is not necessarily true. The main suggestion from these chapters was that a presentation needs to have an overall storyline with story-like features that engage the audience (Duarte, 2010). Seductive details, in contrast, are small stories (not a storyline) that are only tangentially relevant to educational content. The seductive details problem occurs largely when these nonessential stories lack educational content",

    "text": "and become emotional distractions that detract from important learning goals. Emotional features in presentations can be either helpful or detrimental, and here it is largely detrimental. In powerpoint, one potential form of seductive details is the decorative images or content-free graphics that are meant to arouse emotion. Other sources of seductive details and unnecessary cognitive load may come from the nearly infinite number of design possibilities for fonts, colors, layouts, and animated special effects. From the perspective of multimedia learning, unnecessary or content-free features should be eliminated in order to decrease cognitive load and increase the short-term memory available for important learning objectives. The coherence principle suggests that students will do better if designers remove all of these unessential elements. Undesirable cognitive load can also occur when a powerpoint slide deck has inconsistent design features. Significant design changes over the course of the presentation will create a situation in which each new slide will require a bit of extra effort from the audience to adjust to the new appearance. These design inconsistencies create a cognitive cost that may detract from student learning. Empirical support for this possibility comes from a study that deliberately manipulated slide design features to change during a presentation and thereby increase cognitive load or \u201cinterference\u201d (Bradshaw, 2003). The results of this study showed better learning outcomes for the students who received slides that had a consistent design. In contrast, the students who received the inconsistently-designed slides had lower performance. Although this negative impact from inconsistent design is small, these results support the coherence principle. The practical implications",

Novice learners try to take in everything about a topic at one time, which leads to an information overload. The signaling principle proposes that effective instruction should use cues that highlight the most important points. The cues draw attention to the important features and help novice learners to organize information for the learning process. This is the practice of pointing out the most important features to the students. Examples of these cues can be outlines or headers that communicate how the topic is organized. The speaker\u2019s voice can also be used to emphasize certain points, such as the order of topics (first, second, third, etc.) or emphasizing a transition to a new subtopic. Vocal cues such as intonation or emphasis on certain words can also help listeners anticipate the organizational structure of a topic or presentation. Bullet point lists are commonly used in powerpoint presentations to cue the major points for students. Presentation graphics can also use signals that point out important information, such as arrows, highlighted text, or circles around a key point of interest. It seems likely that the signaling principle works by directing limited cognitive resources to the most relevant parts of the topic, which can decrease short-term memory load and promote the formation of new memories.",

    "text": "Several other multimedia learning principles might be useful for designing educational powerpoint presentations. The contiguity principle suggests that the placement of text in relationship to the graphics is important. Strategically placing text near the critical features of the graphical image (spatial contiguity) and together in time with the visual graphic (temporal contiguity) are best for learning due to easing cognitive load requirements for the students. These concepts are similar to the Gestalt law of proximity (see Chapter 8). The segmenting principle suggests that breaking a presentation into smaller parts and giving the learner control over the pacing of the presentation may facilitate learning. For further information about these and other principles of multimedia learning, please refer to comprehensive reviews of this topic (Mayer, 2009; Sweller et al., 1998; van Merri\u00ebnboer and Sweller, 2005). The multimedia learning principles described above are based upon the results of numerous laboratory experiments. A potential weakness is that the laboratory environment might be too artificial and produce results that are not effective for real educational situations. To address this possibility, several studies have tested the multimedia learning principles in powerpoint presentations given to real students. The good news from these studies is that the multimedia learning principles derived from laboratory studies are also effective in the classroom. One study reports that students learn better when powerpoint images and multimedia are combined with text, which supports the multimedia learning principle (Hallett and Faria, 2006). Two studies redesigned standard powerpoint slides to use formats suggested by multimedia learning principles. These studies documented improvements in",

Eliminating unnecessary slide elements and redundant text information also appears to be beneficial for learning (Wecker, 2012), as suggested by the coherence and redundancy principles. Overall, these findings show that the multimedia learning principles from laboratory research are effective when applied to powerpoint presentations used in real classroom situations. As a final note, the use of instructional graphics has complex cognitive effects that are still being teased apart and may eventually yield important new insights. There are also controversies over contradictory experimental findings. Some studies in this area suggest that seductive details, which are those interesting yet irrelevant bits of information that might impair learning, can have neutral or even positive effects on learning in some situations (Park et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2016). The emotional effects created by seductive details are apparently quite complex, with emotional content being beneficial in some situations and harmful in others. Another area of research focuses on cognitive load effects for short-term or long-term learning tasks. Under some conditions, overloading short-term memory may produce improved long- term learning, which is an effect that has been called \u201cdesirable difficulties\u201d (Schweppe and Rummer, 2016). Yet another area of research interest has focused on individual differences in learners, such as comparing high-ability to low-ability students, novices to experts, or high school to college students. In general, novice learners seem to benefit more from multimedia instruction. More knowledgeable students may, in some situations, show impaired learning with multimedia instruction, which has been called the",

As Mayer (2009) has suggested, the principles derived from cognitive research are not absolute rules. These principles are more accurately understood as useful guidelines that are sensitive to a number of conditions. A promising future possibility for multimedia education research is to explore the neurobiological mechanisms that might be responsible for the multimedia learning principles. Horvath (2014) attempts to explain multimedia learning in light of evidence from functional brain imaging studies. Horvath proposes that the redundancy principle (concurrent auditory and visual words decreases learning) occurs because the same auditory cortex areas in the temporal lobe are responsible for processing both silent reading and auditory speech perception. Situations that require reading and hearing words at the same time might create a competition between the two sources of information for access to a single brain area. This limited processing capacity for two streams of information thereby decreasing learning. In contrast, the multimedia principle (improved learning when images are combined with words) may occur because the images and the text are processed in parallel or side-by-side in different brain areas. The visual imagery is processed mostly in the occipital lobe and the ventral temporal lobe, whereas the text and auditory information is processed mostly in the superior temporal lobe. Thus, words and images can be processed in a complementary way in different brain areas, which avoids a conflict over a limited neural resource. This parallel or independent processing of visual and auditory information might explain why words and images",

Neurobiological research on contextual cuing also suggests that having a consistent image size and location on a powerpoint slide, such as the assertion-evidence layout, might promote learning, possibly because the brain needs to expend less effort to analyze repeated visual scenes. The possibility of using brain imaging studies to gain further insights into the optimal powerpoint presentation display conditions is an exciting possibility. However, it is important to keep in mind that the current evidence is somewhat speculative.

This is an example of the signaling principle, which states that clear communication and organization facilitate better learning (see Chapter 9 on the assertion-evidence layout). Their second recommendation is to use the slide sorter view of PowerPoint to organize the overall presentation into more easily digestible parts. Slides with too much information might be easily noticed in the slide sorter view. If there is too much information, then instructors can divide the slide contents across two or more slides. The presenter may also better evaluate the overall story line of the presentation in the slide sorter view. This practice works due to the segmentation principle, which advocates dividing complex information into smaller pieces to avoid the potential problem of overloading the audience with too much information on each slide. The third recommendation is to reduce the amount of text on the slide, which is especially important for presenters who mistakenly attempt to place their entire speech on the screen. Reducing text benefits the audience by helping them to focus on hearing the speaker\u2019s words (narration only). If the speaker needs the text for delivering the speech, it can be put in the \u201cnotes\u201d view of PowerPoint or possibly on paper or notecards. The general idea is that the presenter can see their speaking notes but the audience cannot, which reduces the cognitive load for the audience. This situation is an example of the modality principle: \u201cPeople understand a multimedia explanation better when the words are presented as narration rather than on-screen text\u201d (p. 12).

This process takes effort. During this memory formation process, students can be easily overwhelmed by the amount of information that is being made available to them. Therefore, teachers must take the limitations of short-term memory into account when developing instructional materials. The key takeaway point is to deliver the right amount of information (not too much or too little) while simultaneously decreasing unnecessary details that might burden short-term memory. In addition, we should make strategic use of text and instructional images that complement each other in useful ways to promote student learning.",

    "text": "The information-rich nature of the modern world has changed the focus of education. When information is easily available from the Internet and phone-based digital assistants, there is not as much need for the instructor to be the chief information provider. The critical cognitive skill is being able to use higher order thinking skills to evaluate information. As a result, modern educators view learning as an active process. The modern educator employs creative teaching strategies to facilitate this process of student exploration and understanding, rather than merely imparting information to an audience who has no other access to that information. The focus of education has also changed dramatically as a result of educational theorists who have advanced a conceptual framework that advocates the need for deeper learning. Paulo Freire made the powerful argument that education once operated by a banking model, in which information was deposited into students like money was deposited in a bank (Freire, 2000). Such a learning approach was oppressive. In contrast, the true goal of education should be to empower students to think for themselves. Other educational theorists, such as Malcolm Knowles, Jack Mezirow, Donald Sch\u00f6n, and Stephen Brookfield, have also argued that educators need to aim for deeper, more meaningful forms of learning than simply memorizing information. Evidence from the fields of cognitive psychology and neurobiology is another possible contribution to the movement away from information transfer approaches to education. For example, cognitive psychology research on memory has shown that rote learning may be inferior to strategies that rely upon elaborative encoding of information, such as a more active learning process which relates new information to older, mastered understanding.

    "text": "neuroscience research also suggests the existence for multiple forms of long term memory, such as procedural, semantic, and episodic memories. Altogether, our contemporary view is that a high-quality education needs to be much more than the simple transfer and storage of important information. Although powerpoint is a modern technology, the inherent nature of powerpoint presentations is to gravitate toward passive learning approaches that emphasize information delivery. It seems that passive learning is a default mode of powerpoint presentations. This passivity is not surprising given that the modern powerpoint presentation has historical roots in older technologies associated with lecturing, such as chalkboards and overhead projectors. Teaching excellence with powerpoint will require, to some degree, going against the inherent tendency to use powerpoint for mere information delivery. To achieve active learning, the instructors will need to intentionally use powerpoint to promote active learning classroom situations (Vallance and Towndrow, 2007). We will now explore the ways that powerpoint presentations can promote learning processes. Instructors can use powerpoint to provide support for active learning exercises, and thereby indirectly contribute to important course goals. Such methods include technologies and assignments that infuse a more active learning emphasis into powerpoint. Learning response systems that require student feedback and promote student-instructor interactions and student-authored powerpoint presentations are possible ways of encouraging active learning with powerpoint. There are many other possible approaches, all of which emphasize the stimulation of student cognition.",

By extension, the standard powerpoint presentation that emphasizes information delivery and passive learning for an entire class period is a bad practice. Bligh cautiously points out that lectures are not always bad, even though educators sometimes view lectures with disdain. Bligh\u2019s view is that teachers should \u201c[u]se lectures to teach information. Do not rely on them to promote thought, change attitudes, or develop behavioral skills if you can help it.\u201d (p. 20). Lectures become problematic when instructors overuse the lecture approach. To achieve teaching excellence, we will need to follow Bligh\u2019s advice to break up our traditional lectures with other teaching approaches that emphasize an active learning process. Active learning exercises are small parts of the big puzzle, activities that instructors can sprinkle throughout the class period to break up the monotony of a lecture approach. These activities can supplement the information-delivery focus of powerpoint presentations. The active learning possibilities in powerpoint are very broad. Bligh recommended brief discussion activities during class to break the monotony of a continuous lecture. Burmark suggests using flashcards, digital photo essays, and writing prompts (Burmark, 2004). Berk suggests surveys, reading/interpretation, and reactions to music or video (Berk, 2011). Digital storytelling is another possibility (Robin, 2008). The general idea is that powerpoint slides do not need to always involve presenting",

    "text": "Powerpoint is like a one-way street: Information tends to move from the presenter to the audience. In some cases, powerpoint presentations may even discourage student feedback or interactions between the students and the instructor. This problem could be particularly strong in large lecture situations. Students in large lecture halls may feel uncomfortable asking questions during class due to the potential embarrassment that could occur when speaking in front of 100 or more people. In the late 1990s, new wireless devices were introduced to promote more communication from the student to the instructor and thereby address an important weakness in the typical educational presentation. These wireless response systems go by a wide variety of names, with the most common term being \u201cclickers.\u201d (Business professionals may use the term \u201cclicker\u201d to describe wireless remote control devices that advance a slide presentation, but in the field of education, the word \u201cclicker\u201d is typically used to describe student response systems.) Although a number of different vendors and possible features are available, the most essential characteristic is that this technology enables teachers to collect quick feedback on student learning. Student response system technology is most commonly used for assessing content-based questions in large lecture classes. The",

    "text": "instructor initiates the use of these devices by posing a question to the students on a powerpoint slide. The questions are often in a multiple choice or true-false format: A statement followed by several potential answers. The students answer this question through the student response system device by using buttons like A/B/C/D or Yes/No. Some educators ask their students to briefly discuss the best possible answer with their neighbor after they report their answer via the wireless remote device. The student responses are wirelessly transmitted to a receiver system that collects, tabulates, and displays the results on the computer. The powerpoint display can give students feedback on their answers and also project the classroom responses for the entire class to see. This information provides the instructor with a quick, real-time assessment of student learning. If students seem to be grasping the key concept, the lecturer can move on to new content. In contrast, poor student comprehension can be an important indicator that more class time is needed for the topic. The instructor can also use the student feedback for discussion purposes, for example, to comment on why particular student answers are correct or incorrect. This process typically repeats several times during the class period, with the instructor asking four to six content-based questions during a typical classroom period. A recent trend in classroom response systems is favoring the use of smart phone apps over specialized hardware devices (Roll, 2017). This is a part of a general \u2018bring your own device\u2019 (BYOD) movement that involves personal phone use for business or institutional purposes.

    "text": "system manufacturers, such as Macmillan and Turning Point, are offering both hardware and phone app-based systems. Phone app responses systems offer the practical advantages of increased convenience and possibly lower cost. Student attitudes towards these systems are positive. The potential downsides include phone-based distractions, such as playing games during class, and dropped wireless connections (Miller Griffith and Roberts, 2013; Morrell and Joyce, 2015). Learning strategies based upon student response systems, like content-based questions, effectively promote student learning, with only a few studies finding no benefits (for reviews, see Caldwell, 2007; Kay and LeSage, 2009; Keough, 2012). A good example study was done by Mayer, the multimedia learning expert whose work was discussed in the cognition chapter (see 11), and his colleagues (Mayer et al., 2009). In this study, a student response system group (student response system plus group questioning) was compared to two control groups (no student response system and no group questioning; no student response system with group questioning). The results showed a small but positive increase in the exam scores for the student response system group (83.4%) compared to the control groups that lacked this technology (80.3% and 80.2%). Several possible reasons explain why student response systems and content-based questions might improve student learning. Mayer\u2019s interpretation is that this approach promotes generative learning, such as using attention, organization, and metacognitive skills that are beneficial for deep learning (Mayer et al., 2009). Another study suggests that the benefits may be due to testing effects and feedback (A. M. Shapiro and Gordon,",

    "text": "2013). Many other possible instructional benefits of using student response systems include increased student-teacher interactions, better assessment of student preparation, practice problems, and formative assessments (Caldwell, 2007). Student response systems also give students an opportunity to see how their performance compares to their classmates\u2019 (Dean, 2013). Let\u2019s say that two- thirds of a class answers an instructor-posed question correctly. The remaining students who got the answer wrong must face the uncomfortable truth that they were in the minority are, therefore, behind the rest of the class. This ability for the students to see where they stand in relation to their peers may put social pressure on the lagging students to work harder. It seems natural to view the student response system technology as the source of important student learning gains in these studies, but this view is somewhat inaccurate. Several carefully designed studies suggest that the improved learning comes from questions, projects, assignments, and student discussions rather than the technology itself (Anthis, 2011; Christopherson, 2011; Fallon and Forrest, 2011; Zayac, Ratkos, Frieder, and Paulk, 2016). The learning gains are caused by posing questions or challenges to students that engage active learning (for examples, see Strauss, Corrigan, and Hofacker, 2011). In essence, the pedagogy is the real source of learning gains, not the technology. This understanding is useful because it suggests that there may be ways to capture many of the benefits of student response systems without the need to purchase and implement special technology. For example, student response system technology might be unnecessary in small classrooms in which students can use traditional means of responding, like raised hands. Focusing too much on the",

    "text": "technology can lead educators astray by taking their focus away from the elements of teaching that are the most important for improving educational outcomes. Both student and faculty perceptions of student response system technology tend to be positive. One review found that 89% of the student response system studies have an increase in student satisfaction (Keough, 2012). Most studies also show increases in perceived performance, attention, and attendance. Student response systems also increase student-faculty interactions, including ones not dependent on the technology. Increased interaction occurs because some students are more likely to use the response system for class participation compared to other means, such as asking questions, because the voting is anonymous and avoids the possibility of public embarrassment. Overall student engagement can be increased because voting on a question is a way that teachers can reach out to students and make them feel like they are involved in class activities. For negatives, students may be concerned about the additional costs of these systems if they are required to purchase their own response system device or must access a phone app. Technical downsides can include broken or lost remote devices and possible system failures, such as dropped wireless connections. Some faculty members may be concerned about the increased preparation time it might take to incorporate these device activities into their powerpoint presentations. The amount of class time available for covering course content may also be decreased if more time is devoted to question-focused activities. These negative points may be small problems, but they are still important to consider for teachers who might use a student response system.",

A much wider range of creative possibilities are available. The devices can be used for interactive games, like the television game show Jeopardy! Some faculty use these devices to record attendance. Student response systems can also be used in conjunction with student discussion activities. For example, students can discuss the answers to a complex problem in small groups and then report their conclusion to the instructor via the response system technology. The devices could be used to vote for the winners of a debate contest. These ideas are only a small sampling of the possibilities that might be enabled by having a quick and efficient means of collecting responses and opinions from students in the classroom. The present description of the potential benefits from active questioning methods and student response system technology is just a brief overview. For more, the interested reader should begin by reading review articles that cover the advantages and disadvantages of these systems (Caldwell, 2007; Kay and LeSage, 2009; Keough, 2012).

    "text": "popular with students, but downsides exist, such as the promotion of passive note-taking. One idea for improving student note- taking quality is to provide a partial or incomplete resource to the students rather than the common practice of making the full slide decks available to students. The instructor-provided resources are partial because key terms are missing or important bits of information must be completed by the students during the class period. In most studies, using a partial resource in this manner produces better learning outcomes than either no notes or complete instructor notes (Annis, 1981; Cornelius and Owen-DeSchryver, 2008; Katayama and Crooks, 2003; Kiewra et al., 1988; but see also Stark-Wroblewski et al., 2006 for negative results). The often beneficial, though not universal, effects of instructor- provided partial notes seem to come from a delicate balance between providing useful information and requiring active involvement. These incomplete notes provide enough information to be a guide for facilitating student note-taking, yet they are not so information-rich as to encourage a completely passive approach to note-taking and possibly poor class attendance. The need for student effort and engagement with partial notes presumably facilitates learning by requiring an effortful formation of memory and other cognition by providing useful scaffolding to help novices. As a practical matter, the creation of partial note resources, notably, will require some additional effort from the instructor. At present, most teachers who make their powerpoint files available online are simply uploading the same file that they use during the class presentation. To make the note-taking resource incomplete, the instructor will need to go through the powerpoint file and remove information in critical spots. This creates gaps that the",

    "text": "students must actively fill with their own notes when they are in class. Another possible way to make powerpoint slides into an incomplete resource is to save the outline as a text file without any images. Any information presented through the images or diagrams would need to be recorded by students as part of their note-taking activities. Pardini and colleagues have proposed a different note-taking technique for online instructor-provided notes (Pardini, Domizi, Forbes, and Pettis, 2005). Their idea, which they call the parallel system, also involves active learning and was inspired by the split page or Cornell system for student note-taking. The system begins with the students downloading and printing the slide deck before class. On the back of each page, the students draw a vertical line two inches from the left side of the page. On the wider right side part of the page, the students take notes during class. This\\\\e information that the students record is done in parallel with the printed powerpoint resource. The narrow margin on the left side is used for annotations that reflect higher order thinking. These comments might include questions, synthesis, relationships, and possible comments about points that need further study. In other words, the left margin encourages a metacognitive assessment of issues and insights that are related to the content-oriented notes on the right. This parallel note-taking system has several advantages. This system shows students an effective way to use instructor-provided slide decks plus student notes as a \u201chybrid text\u201d (Pardini et al., 2005). The strategy communicates to students that instructor- provided resources are intended to guide learning, rather than replace the need for note-taking. Doing so gets away from the",

You simply can\u2019t fake expertise when you are in front of an audience. The fact that understanding must precede teaching can make student presentation assignments a valuable method for promoting active learning. A presentation assignment requires students to take a careful inventory of what they know about a topic. During the development of the presentation, students will need to make critical decisions about the importance and relationships of the different aspects of their topic information. The use of powerpoint can play a strong role in this creative process by providing an organizing point for the presentation materials that will be shown to the audience. Presentation assignments have a number of positive features (Marmien\u0117, 2006). The projects are student-directed, which is an active, hands-on way to learn. Student presentations involve the integration of several abilities, including speaking, listening, writing, and analyzing.

Finally, presentations also provide a good opportunity for students to develop their public speaking skills, which is good preparation for future career activities. The effectiveness of a present-to-learn teaching strategy is documented in several studies. In these studies, the assigned task was to make a presentation that included a powerpoint visual aid. When students in a present-to-learn group are compared to students exposed to a more traditional learning situation (no presentations), the group that was required to make presentations showed greater mastery of the subject (Gunel, Hand, and Gunduz, 2006; G\u00fcrb\u00fcz et al., 2010; Kisoglu, Erkol, Dilber, and Gurbuz, 2012; Siegle and Foster, 2001). Many studies of the present-to-learn approach emphasize cooperative learning as a natural fit to the practice of giving presentations. Teachers have reported successful collaborative presentations in a wide range of disciplines and age groups, including middle school students with disabilities (Kelly, 1999), middle school social studies students (Dils, 2000), undergraduate chemistry students (Pence, 1997), and MBA graduate students (M. A. Levin and Peterson, 2013). Student perceptions of a present-to-learn teaching strategy are also positive (Blake, Poranek, and MacCulloch, 2007; Kisoglu et al., 2012; Seo, Templeton, and Pellegrino, 2008). Modern presentation software has online technology that can be particularly useful for presentations developed through a collaborative group effort.

These collaborative features should be useful for facilitating group work because the students do not have to share a file back and forth, such as sending email attachments several times between group members. The slide formats used for preparing student presentations can significantly influence the degree of student learning in a present- to-learn strategy. One study compared undergraduate engineering students who were instructed to create a presentation using the assertion-evidence slide layout to another group of students who were allowed to design their slides in whatever manner they wished (Garner and Alley, 2016). The students in the latter group mostly designed slides with bullet point list characteristics. The students who made assertion-evidence slides performed better on a surprise quiz compared to the students in the other condition. The assertion-evidence slide format intriguingly had a significant positive impact on the presenter\u2019s mastery of the subject material. Although student presentations have strong active learning possibilities, they also include significant downsides. A small number of students are extremely anxious about public speaking situations. It might be necessary, therefore, to have some kind of alternative assignment available for people who have extreme fears of public speaking. Poor attendance on presentation dates can be another significant problem. In one report, attendance fell to about 20% on the student presentation days (Dobson, 2006). The classroom logistics of having traditional, face-to-face student presentations can also be problematic.

    "text": "can be exacerbated by student presentations that run over the time limits. Valuable time might be wasted in the transition between different presenters. Levin and Peterson suggest a creative solution to some of these student presentation problems based on a little-used PowerPoint feature (M. A. Levin and Peterson, 2013). Each student can make a presentation on their own time and use PowerPoint to record their voice as a narration (the \u201crecord slide show\u201d function). This recording feature saves the narration along with the slides, which results in a digital presentation. The narrated slide deck can be electronically submitted to the instructor as a video file for grading. The recorded narration idea raises other instructional possibilities, such as peer-review grading of presentations or alternative presentation assignments for people with social anxiety problems. Narrated powerpoint presentations saved as digital files could also be useful assignments for online course formats. Teachers who assign presentations will almost surely get problems related to powerpoint technology. Inexperienced student presenters often have common problems like bad slide themes, animated bullet points, and too much text. A good starting point to address these issues is to set limits and rules for acceptable presentations, such as rules against using gratuitous animations and slide transitions. Students also need rules on time requirements, like the minimum and maximum times, to guide the development of their presentation. In addition to rules, instructors can provide guidance by giving the students a slide template (default background and other formatting features) that will serve as the foundation for all of the student presentations. Doing so will help to prevent the use of unusual slide decorations",

Developing presentation skills is desirable, but skill development is a secondary goal for most courses. Another problem is that student presentations often go over their allotted time limits, which creates logistical problems. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if there was a straightforward way to quickly and easily prevent these bad presentation practices from occurring in student presentations? Some instructors have successfully implemented a specific style of powerpoint presentation that seems to accomplish these goals with very little work on the instructor\u2019s part. The pecha kucha presentation places severe constraints on presenters with two very simple rules: twenty slides, and twenty seconds for each slide (20 x 20).

The term \u201cpecha kucha\u201d is the Japanese equivalent of the English term \u201cchit chat,\u201d which is consistent with its initial use for giving presentations to small groups. The pecha kucha style has grown into an international movement in which people gather in public venues for pecha kucha-style presentations, somewhat like open mic nights for poetry readings. In a pecha kucha presentation, the slides are set to automatically advance every twenty seconds with no intervention from the speaker. This time limit fundamentally changes powerpoint presentations in ways that prevent many bad practices. The emphasis on brevity forces the presenter to get to the main point without meandering through digressions and off-topic musings. Long text passages and numerous bullet points must be avoided because these would be too long to read in twenty seconds. The emphasis in pecha kucha presentations is on graphical images, with text being used sparingly or not at all. The lack of text prevents speakers from using the slide as a teleprompter, which prevents another common presentation problem. The pecha kucha format has features that make it well-suited to classroom use. The length of an entire pecha kucha presentation is just under seven minutes (20 slides x 20 seconds = 400 seconds or 6 minutes, 40 seconds). Students cannot run over their time limit because the timing is automatically controlled by the software. This helps the instructor with the logistics and planning for several pecha kucha presentations in a single class period. The constraints of pecha kucha benefits presenters by making them edit their message to focus on the essential ideas. The overall time limit of about seven minutes is short enough to make it easy",

All of these positive benefits are achieved without requiring the instructor to put significant time and effort into teaching students good presentation practices. Pecha kucha presentations given by students are perceived as being more interesting and enjoyable than a traditional powerpoint presentation (Beyer, 2011). The pecha kucha format has been used successfully for student presentations in a wide range of academic disciplines, including business (Anderson and Williams, 2012; M. A. Levin and Peterson, 2013), psychology (Beyer, 2011), statistics (Wolverton, Butler, Martinson, and Thomas, 2014), and English (Gries and Brooke, 2010; Wolverton et al., 2014). Although the use of pecha kucha in a writing class might seem somewhat surprising, it is apparently very useful for teaching about powerful visual metaphors and the importance of the editing process in creative works (Gries and Brooke, 2010). The pecha kucha format does not result in higher learning scores compared to students who merely watch a presentation (Klentzin, Paladino, Johnston, and Devine, 2010), but the active learning involved in creating a pecha kucha presentation are rated by students as being a valuable learning experience (M. A. Levin and Peterson, 2013). Teachers who are interested in using the pecha kucha style for class projects will need to invest some time into preparing the students for this format. It will take effort on the instructor\u2019s part to make the students clearly understand that pecha kucha is not the same as a typical powerpoint presentation. Showing an example pecha kucha presentation is a good way to start (many are available online; see www.pechakucha.org).

One possibility is to use powerpoint for organizing classroom discussion activities. The question that represents the focal point of discussion could be displayed on the projection screen at the front of the room. This facilitates discussion because the question has a visual persistence: It does not fade from memory like a question delivered by voice might. Students can refer back to this question as they form their responses. Other details about the discussion activity could also be listed on this slide. This might save the instructor from distributing paper handouts that describe the assignment or repeatedly announcing the activity requirements. Using powerpoint in this manner may have a beneficial effect by guiding the class through an active learning exercise. In psychology, important phenomena can sometimes be direct- ly conveyed to the students so that the students can experience it for themselves.

    "text": "presentation. This direct experience with the subject matter may facilitate the formation of memories that are both verbal (from the powerpoint text) and experiential (from the demonstration). Educators who teach science, math, or engineering may benefit from the highly visual nature of brief videos or animations that illustrate the movements of complex objects. Projection technology could be used to show students a live view of a microscopic image. In math classes, problems can be projected on to the screen for the students to solve. After this, the answers can be revealed on the following slide, along with an explanation. This approach requires student involvement and provides feedback on the answers (see Chapter 16 for an example). A Spanish teacher shared a simple active learning exercise that she uses to promote active learning. The powerpoint displays short passages in Spanish on the screen. The students take turns reading these passages out loud to the rest of the class, which makes the students an active participant in the powerpoint presentation. The students benefit by getting feedback on their efforts. The rest of the class sees role models of good (and maybe not-so- good) pronunciations. Witnessing these examples from other students can form the basis of an observational learning process. Student involvement in this exercise is quite high because there is some social pressure to perform well. A similar approach will work well in other classes. In Sensation & Perception, I explain the different forms of monocular cues for depth perception to the students, along with examples. This is followed by a series of full- screen images from sites around the college campus. The students are asked to identify examples of the various monocular depth perception cues in the scene with a brief explanation of why this",

    "text": "situation illustrates a particular concept. Powerpoint provides the means to accomplish this kind of rich active learning experience. The important take-home idea is that the multimedia capabilities of powerpoint may facilitate active learning exercises. Embedded videos might serve as a launching point for an in- class discussion. The use of hyperlinks might help to organize information in a fashion that is organic and nonlinear. Links to different slide topics in the slide deck might be helpful to support learning processes. In this manner, powerpoint can be seen as a computer programming platform for educators. It enables instructors to assemble a rich assortment of information in creative ways to provide a stimulating experience that promotes active student learning. This medium can clearly be much more than overly simple lists of points that form the basis of most current powerpoint presentations.  All that is needed is a creative learning approach, one that goes beyond a chalkboard-like use of powerpoint technology. There are numerous ways to promote active learning with powerpoint, many of which may be specific to a particular topic or discipline. A common factor in all of these is to structure the powerpoint to provide students a challenge based upon the subject phenomenon. After this, it is up to the students to think deeply about the challenge, take action, and give an appropriate answer or response. The requirement of student involvement in these challenges should be interesting and beneficial to the learning process. It requires students to shift from absorbing information to actually using the new concepts in a realistic and productive manner. In addition, students can evaluate their own learning when they receive feedback on their responses to the challenge. There are also",

    "text": "The guiding spirit of this chapter is that the default role of powerpoint\u2014information delivery\u2014is not as important in modern education as it once was. Because the focus of modern education is more constructivist, the traditional use of powerpoint should be intentionally suspended at strategic moments during a lecture to make room for active learning. Doing so gives students a needed break from the task of absorbing more and more information. At these critical points, the teaching mission can switch from information delivery to active learning exercises that involve questions, discussions, or other activities. Lectures are good for information delivery, but teachers need to mix up the lecture approach with other learning strategies to promote the best educational outcomes. Powerpoint is still a useful teaching technology even when it is not being used for information delivery. There are many ways that powerpoint can be used to promote active learning, such as student response system quizzes and present-to-learn approaches. Using powerpoint in these atypical ways must become a standard practice if we want to promote higher-order learning processes.",

This student\u2019s variation was slightly different though, and it had a lasting impact on me. \u201cAre we just copying today?\u201d Thie question caught me off-guard. At first, it wasn\u2019t clear to me what the student meant, so I hesitated. I had never thought of my class as being a mere copying exercise. After a moment, I responded with something like \u201cIf you feel that this situation is urgent, you don\u2019t have to come to class today.\u201d The student was satisfied with this response, and I went ahead with teaching the class, just like usual. The \u201ccopy\u201d question stuck with me after this class period was over. It seemed that this student viewed my carefully prepared presentations as a simple information transfer exercise: The professor puts something up on the screen and the students copy it down. If this was true, the class required minimal note-taking effort and no active thought process. The question suggested disengagement from the course. This experience was a critical moment, one that makes a teacher deeply question their methods and search for finding a better way to increase student engagement. Perhaps this book can be viewed as the culmination of years of professional development towards answering this \u201ccopying\u201d question. It sparked a search for finding powerpoint presentation techniques that would really engage students, stimulate thought, and produce a more authentic kind of learning. After this episode, I began looking for signs of simple power- point copying. These signs can sometimes be detected while walk-",

In one study, students indicated a strong agreement with this question: \u201cOverall, note-taking is very important to my academic success.\u201d (Williams et al., 2013, p. 96). However, the benefits of note-taking are not merely perceived; evidence from cognitive science research supports the utility of this practice. One way note-taking helps students is by providing a form of information storage. Essential information can be recorded as notes and then studied at a later time. Students generally view note-taking as being important for information storage reasons (Badger, White, Sutherland, and Haggis, 2001). From a learning theory perspective, the use of notes as an information storage device suggests an information transfer model of learning. Information is moved from the teacher\u2019s mind to the student\u2019s notes and, eventually, the student\u2019s memory. There is more to note-taking than simply storing information. A secondary role of note-taking involves the active selection and organization of important information from the presented material (Di Vesta and Gray, 1972; Hartley and Davies, 1978; Howe, 1974). During the note-taking process, students actively relate new information to ideas that they already understand in order to form a new level of understanding. This means that the activity of note- taking does more than simply store information on paper. Note- taking actually helps to form long-term memories and schemata (conceptual organization) in the brain. In cognitive psychology, this phenomenon has been variously called the encoding effect or the generative role of note-taking. In the field of education, this function might be called active learning, a term which implies more than just passive student listening, or constructivism, a",

    "text": "term used to refer to a personal, subjective understanding of the course content. The encoding-related effects of note-taking may be small and may depend on a multitude of factors (for a review, see Kobayasi, 2005). In real educational situations, students likely benefit from both information storage and the encoding of new memory during the note-taking process. Even though students understand the importance of taking notes, research studies of their behavior have clearly documented that students tend to be poor note-takers. In one typical study, students only recorded about 50% of the main ideas from a lecture (Baker and Lombardi, 1985). The range of recording critical information in notes is from 11% to 70%, with most studies reporting around 25% to 50% of the key ideas being captured (Kiewra, 1985). In contrast, most students believe that their note- taking skills are be very strong (Williams et al., 2013). The low rate of recording important information in student notes is problematic for both the storage and the encoding functions of note-taking. If the goal of taking notes is information storage, then poor note-taking fails on that front because missing information cannot be used later to study for an examination. In addition, when students omit lecture information from notes, it suggests that they view this content as being unimportant, making it unlikely that the information was encoded into their long-term memory. Given these problems, a long-standing concern in the field of note-taking research has been to improve the quality of student notes. Better notes will hopefully translate into better study materials and a more active encoding of information into memory, eventually leading to better performance on examinations.",

    "text": "An important reason to use powerpoint in education is to highlight the key ideas in a presentation. If a concept is on the teacher\u2019s slides, the students will interpret this information as being important and will record it in their notes. In multimedia learning theory, this could be called a signaling effect: The presence of a key term on a slide communicates to students the importance of the idea. Research on student note-taking provides strong evidence that students view the material presented in powerpoint slides as being important and, therefore, worthy of recording (Badger et al., 2001). Experimental studies also show that the use of powerpoint increased the quality of student notes (Austin, Lee, and Carr, 2004). One study compared students given different cues for recording information, such as powerpoint slides, verbal cues, or discussion cues. This study found a high rate of recording information from powerpoint slides, but much lower rates of recording information from the other sources (Huxam, 2010). This finding is consistent with earlier studies that were done with overhead transparencies and chalkboards (Baker and Lombardi, 1985; Locke, 1977). In one study, students recorded almost everything (88%) that was written on the chalkboard, but information not written on the chalkboard was recorded only 51.6% of the time (Locke, 1977). A similar study showed an even lower rate (27%) of note-taking for information that was not on the chalkboard (Locke, 1975). Overall, the research consistently shows that students are much more likely to record information presented to them in a visual rather than a spoken form.",

    "text": "These research findings show that powerpoint addresses the important note-taking problem of clearly communicating the key ideas from a lecture to the students. Anything that the instructor believes to be important should be put into the visual slide presentation. The visual presence in the slides sends a clear message to students that this material is important and worthy of being in the notes. Powerpoint use should help to increase the number of important points from a class that students capture in their notes. Although powerpoint sends helpful note-taking cues, potential problems still exist with using powerpoint to guide student note- taking efforts. One problem is that some students record rather little in their notes, even when instructors use powerpoint to cue students about the important points (Huxam, 2010). A related problem is that much of the information that students record from a powerpoint slide could accurately be described as verbatim note- taking: Their notes are an exact replica of the slide information, such as Figure 13.1. The problem with verbatim notes is that such note-takers have made very little effort to understand key terms or make connections between concepts, both of which are crucial parts of the learning process. For example, one study found that only 22% of the notes were of sufficient quality to demonstrate understanding (Huxam, 2010). A third potential problem is that some students may still struggle with identifying the key ideas, even when these ideas are presented on the powerpoint slide (Haynes, McCarley, and Williams, 2015; Williams et al., 2016). Students may view all of the information from a powerpoint presentation as being of equal importance, even when this is clearly not true.

In sum, it appears that powerpoint provides a useful yet only partial solution to guiding student note-taking efforts. Instructors can use powerpoint to clearly signal the content and ideas that are important and encourage the recording of this information in notes. The problem, though, is that relying on powerpoint for these signals generally leads to low-quality records of the presented information which show little evidence of understanding or other higher-level thinking skills. Again, this problem is not unique to powerpoint (e.g., Locke, 1977); it may be more accurate to say that powerpoint is not a magical panacea for the problem of poor note-taking.",

One form of assistance takes the form of outlines of the lecture material, sometimes called \u2018partial notes\u2019 (Annis, 1981; Kiewra, 1985; Kiewra et al., 1988). The intent for providing this resource is to give students a framework for organizing the topic material. The students\u2019 job is to fill in the details of the framework with their own notes taken during class (see also Chapter 12). In general, these instructor- provided materials would meet two important needs of note- taking.

    "text": "from the need to record lots of lecture information. Students could then direct their note-taking effort toward recording thoughts, reactions, and other kinds of active or constructive learning that might help the encoding of long-term memories. A different type of solution, particularly if students are poor at recording information, is to give the students highly-detailed handouts (Katayama and Crooks, 2003; Kiewra, 1985; Kiewra et al., 1988). Full notes are somewhat helpful, but the students who are given these resources typically do not perform as well as students who receive partial notes. The complete notes decrease the students\u2019 need to work at note-taking, and the corresponding lack of student effort translates into lower grades. From a cognitive psychology perspective, it is possible to decrease the cognitive load too much, removing all need for effortful processing. The students clearly need to put some effort into recording notes in order to form new memories. Although early studies showed that providing partial notes assisted note-taking, it was not widely adopted in practice. In the 1970s and 1980s, making paper copies of note-taking resources and distributing them before class was cumbersome. The transition to powerpoint technology dramatically changed this process by eliminating the need for paper copies altogether. It is now relatively easy for teachers to upload their powerpoint files or lecture outlines to an online course management system, such as Blackboard, Brightspace, or Moodle. Students can access the presentation files before or during class and then use these resources to augment their note-taking during the class presentation. Students strongly approve of having online access to their teacher\u2019s powerpoint files (Badger et al., 2001; Worthington and",

The students do not have to copy down every word because some of the material is already available to them. Thus, the students can annotate the powerpoint file or print-out with their own thoughts, insights, possible exam questions, and issues for further clarification. Some students feel that access to the powerpoint slides is useful for keeping up with the rapid pace of a presentation and avoiding information overload (Sambrook and Rowley, 2010). Non-native English speakers and students with reading disabilities or hearing impairments may feel that the instructor-provided notes are valuable resources (Sambrook and Rowley, 2010). Students also like to use powerpoint files as a study guide when they prepare for exams. One student survey found that 69.2% of students \u201calways\u201d and 15.4% \u201cusually\u201d use instructor-provided powerpoint files as review material before tests (Debevec, Shih, and Kashyap, 2006). There is another dimension to powerpoint that should also be considered, one that is broader than serving the note-taking needs of students. The modern use of powerpoint in our culture has two purposes. The first and most obvious purpose is to support presentations. The second purpose of powerpoint, which is newer and less obvious, is to preserve a record of information that was given during a meeting. This usually means storing the powerpoint slide deck file online or on a corporate network so the people in the audience can access it at a later time. This dual role of powerpoint\u2014presentation and document\u2014has become a standard practice in business and government (Knoblauch, 2012; Nathans- Kelly and Nicometo, 2014).

Although the practice of providing powerpoint files for students is now commonplace, it is worth examining whether or not having access to these files can really improve student performance on exams. Many studies have been conducted to address this question. Some of these studies employ an experimental approach (Does powerpoint file access cause better exam performance?) and some of these studies have taken a correlational approach (Is there a relationship or pattern between students downloading the slides and course grades?). The overall research findings are mixed. Out of fifteen reviewed studies, only six report a positive effect of providing powerpoint files online to students (Austin et al., 2004; Chen and Lin, 2008; Cornelius and Owen-DeSchryver, 2008; Frank, Shaw, and Wilson, 2008; Grabe, Christoperson, and Douglas, 2004; Hammonds, 2003). In contrast, seven studies found no improvement (Bowman, 2009; Debevec et al., 2006; Noppe, 2007; Nouri and Shahid, 2008; Stark-Wroblewski et al., 2006; Vandehey, Marsh, and Diekhoff, 2005; Worthington and Levasseur, 2015), and one study found a decline in grades (Weatherly, Grabe, and Arthur, 2002) for students who had powerpoint file access. One report had mixed results, with handouts leading to improvement in one experiment and no improvement in another (Marsh and Sink, 2010). Even when powerpoint file availability is beneficial, it seems that the benefits are small, with reported grade increases of only 3.5% to 6% across the entire class (Chen and Lin, 2008; Grabe et al., 2004).

It could be that students who download powerpoint files have other characteristics associated with greater academic success\u2014such as being more organized or having more proactive study skills\u2014that could cause them to do well on an exam with or without powerpoint file access. A simple explanation for the weak educational benefits of slide deck availability is that many students do not use the available slide decks to guide their note-taking. Studies show that only thirty-five to fifty percent of students download slide decks before class, which is when this resource would be most beneficial for guiding note-taking efforts (Chen and Lin, 2008; Debevec et al., 2006; Grabe et al., 2004; Worthington and Levasseur, 2015). In one study, only eight percent of the students printed the slides before class to use as a note-taking resource (I. Wilson, 2016). Clearly, many students do not seem to take advantage of instructor-provided resources for improving their notes. Another problem is that the effectiveness of instructor-provided notes can be diminished if students do not understand how they should use instructor-provided resources. For example, students may be uncertain about whether they should add more information to the powerpoint file during class, or if they should just listen attentively to the instructor without writing anything down. Some students also complain that instructor-provided resources may have too much information or are poorly organized, which might decrease their educational effectiveness (Pardini et al., 2005).

    "text": "effectiveness of online powerpoint resources. A good starting point is whether or not the full slide deck should be made available. A number of studies suggest that partial notes, such as an outline, may be more beneficial than a more detailed set of notes (Annis, 1981; Cornelius and Owen-DeSchryver, 2008; Katayama and Crooks, 2003). Partial notes provide needed information and guidance, yet they still require a more active level of student involvement than full notes. Another decision when posting powerpoint files online concerns the resource format. Students seem to prefer text- based resources, such as bullet points, over image-based or audio- based resources (Garrett, 2015; Grabe and Christoperson, 2008). The student preference for text over images suggests that it might be worthwhile to convert a powerpoint presentation, particularly one that is image-heavy, to a text-only outline for sharing with the students. The timing of the resource availability is also important. Instructors should make these resources available before the class so the students will be able to use these resources as guides for their note-taking efforts during class. A possible variation is to make partial notes available before class (to help encoding and active learning) and full notes available after class. Just as we should not assume that students naturally know how to take good notes, we also should not assume that students will naturally know how to use note-taking resources that the instructor provides. Less than half of the students will print the powerpoint file before class when this resource is available. This suggests that students may need direct encouragement or instruction to download and print powerpoint files before class. Students may also need help in using this resource to identify the most important ideas to record in their notes (Haynes et al., 2015; I. Wilson, 2016).",

Since class attendance is known to be important for college success, any influence that powerpoint might have on attendance could be either helpful or harmful. Several early studies found that attendance was improved in courses that used powerpoint presentations, presumably due to increased student motivation (Daniels, 1999; Evans, 1998 as cited in Szabo and Hastings, 2000; Susskind, 2005; Szabo and Hastings, 2000). Other studies, in contrast, have found that the use of powerpoint has no effect on student attendance, either positive or negative (Beets and Lobinger, 2001; Frey and Birnbaum, 2002; Sambrook and Rowley, 2010; Susskind, 2008). One interpretation of these mixed research findings is that powerpoint presentations may have boosted attendance when it was a new technology, but may not increase attendance at the present time because powerpoint is no longer a novelty to students (L. A. Burke and James, 2008). In one set of studies, students were more likely",

    "text": "to self-report that they would attend a lecture with a powerpoint on a survey (Susskind, 2005), but a subsequent study based on actual attendance records was unable to confirm a real increase in attendance (Susskind, 2008). This difference between student perceptions and actual attendance records might also explain why some studies find increased attendance while other studies find no evidence of improved attendance. Altogether, the research findings suggest that using powerpoint in the classroom probably has no significant influence on student attendance or, at the very least, cannot provide a guarantee of increased attendance. The possibility that powerpoint might change student attendance for the worse is relevant to the common practice of making powerpoint files available online to students. Concerns have been raised that students who can download a powerpoint presentation are less likely to attend class (e.g., Schuman, 2014). In particular, if students view a class lecture as a simple information transfer exercise (i.e., \u201ccopying\u201d), then getting the key points from an online powerpoint file makes class attendance completely unnecessary. It would be much more efficient for students to simply download the file and not bother taking the time to attend class. To address this possibility, several studies have asked this question: Will classroom attendance decrease if powerpoint files are made available to students? Again, the research evidence is mixed. A few reports of powerpoint use indicate decreasing class attendance. One professor observed a 20% drop in attendance when powerpoint files were made available to the students (Young, 2004), although this evidence is anecdotal and should be interpreted with caution. In one survey, students reported that they were less likely to",

In another student survey, the students reported that having instructor-provided notes would not negatively affect their own attendance, but it might negatively affect the attendance of other students (Sambrook and Rowley, 2010). In contrast, the majority of studies on attendance did not find decreased attendance when slide decks were made available to students. Ten empirical studies, based on varying research methodologies, report no adverse attendance effects from posting powerpoint slide decks online for student access (Bowman, 2009; L. A. Burke and James, 2008; Cornelius and Owen-DeSchryver, 2008; Debevec et al., 2006; Frank et al., 2008; Frey and Birnbaum, 2002; Grabe and Christoperson, 2008; Gurrie and Fair, 2008; Vandehey et al., 2005; Worthington and Levasseur, 2015). One study suggests that students with certain learning style preferences might be less likely to attend class if powerpoint slides can be downloaded, even though there was no overall decline in attendance for the class as a whole (Debevec et al., 2006). Several studies that failed to find a connection between powerpoint slide downloads and poor attendance did, however, find a general influence of attendance on grades. In other words, students who have poor attendance tend to do worse in class regardless of whether or not they have downloaded the powerpoint file (Bowman, 2009; Debevec et al., 2006; Worthington and Levasseur, 2015). Again, the real association at work here may be the influence of personal characteristics such as poor work ethic or ineffective study habits, which could affect both attendance and grades independently of powerpoint availability.",

In one study, 17% of the students said that they were less likely to attend class when powerpoint was available online. However, the overall results suggested that most students felt that attendance was important and that online access to the powerpoint files was useful for note-taking activities (Gurrie and Fair, 2008). This pattern is likely true with many classes. Perhaps attendance is only a problem for a small proportion of students who are weakly motivated and who are at risk for doing poorly in class anyway. Powerpoint file access and regular attendance might still be valued by most of the class. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that giving powerpoint file access to students causes lower attendance only when the teacher misuses powerpoint in a particular pattern. First, the powerpoint slides contain a large amount of text, which turns the powerpoint file into a stand-alone document. In other words, the powerpoint file by itself is sufficient to be understood without any commentary from the teacher. The second related condition is bad presentation practices, such as the teacher merely reading the text from the powerpoint display to the students, which most students find boring or even aggravating. When a detailed slide deck is available to students and is combined with a boring presentation style, the students might conclude that class time is simply not valuable. We should emphasize that this pattern does not describe good teaching practices. This pattern results in the dullest kind of class, and it seems likely that attendance might suffer in this kind of situation regardless of whether or not the powerpoint files were available outside of class sessions.

Because, again, students really prefer the text from powerpoint presentations, simply providing the text rather than the full powerpoint slides would be most useful. A text-only resource would be missing some information, which would make it similar to the partial notes conditions that produced the best learning outcomes in some notetaking studies. Student attendance and engagement would still be needed to fill in the gaps of missing information. This chapter began with a story about how students might view powerpoint presentations as a mere copying exercise. This does not have to be the standard student experience. The use of better slide designs, such as using multimedia principles to guide slide construction, should result in a more engaging learning event. In addition, teachers need to ensure they use active learning methods as a part of the course. Taking these steps will ensure that students view class time as a meaningful and engaging learning experience, so they will hopefully make a strong effort to attend every class period.",

Having a multitude of software features is usually viewed as being positive, but it can occasionally be the source of problems. Users can become overwhelmed with too many software features, including features that may potentially harm the quality of presentations. For example, PowerPoint provides many possibilities for generic clip- art, overly fanciful slide templates, and unnecessary animations that most presentation experts warn against using. Another practical drawback is that the software can be expensive. This may not matter much to faculty who have computers provided by their schools, but the cost may be an important barrier to students who need to design presentations for classroom projects. PowerPoint software has a long history compared to most contemporary computer technology. While a positive in many regards, this legacy or long tradition may also been seen as problematic. Standard features of PowerPoint may not be well suited to classroom use for a variety of historical reasons, such as being developed for business needs rather than educational needs. The original designers of PowerPoint were computer programmers who had no background in giving presentations. Fundamental aspects of PowerPoint slides, such as the emphasis on bullet points, can be viewed as a carryover from the limitations of the 1990s personal computers. These historical roots have created potentially problematic standards of emphasizing text over images in PowerPoint presentations. Another legacy hardware downside is that PowerPoint tends to favor files that are located on a local hard disk. This local storage inclination is at odds with the",

    "text": "increasingly online nature of information such as web pages and videos. Current versions of PowerPoint have features for using links and cloud-based computer files, but these features can feel like awkward add-ons to a product that was originally intended for desktop computers. Most recently, Microsoft has begun to embrace the modern networked computing environment with web-based versions of PowerPoint in Office 365. Perhaps future versions will be friendlier to online information. There are two notable software alternatives for desktop or laptop computers that closely match the features and capabilities of PowerPoint. For Apple computers, Keynote is a presentation application from the iWork office software suite. Keynote was used to develop and deliver the media presentations in Al Gore\u2019s award-winning \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d documentary (see http://www.duarte.com/portfolio/an-irresistible-keynote/), which demonstrates the powerful potential of this software. A limitation of Keynote is that it only runs on Apple computer products. The second notable PowerPoint alternative is Impress from the LibreOffice/OpenOffice software suite. This application has almost all of the same features as PowerPoint, making it a work- alike clone. Impress is available for free and runs on Windows, Apple, or Linux-based computers. Having several software possibilities can be a downside because these technologies are incompatible with each other. Situations may arise in which a presentation was created in Keynote or Impress but the classroom projection system is based on PowerPoint. This is particularly likely to occur when students occasionally use these PowerPoint alternatives to create classroom presentations. Fortunately, there are easy solutions. Both Keynote and Impress",

This portability trend has increasingly emphasized online applications that are hosted on remote computers and accessed through a web browser on a hand-held device. This trend towards online computing resources is reflected in a number of web-based presentation applications, such as Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint 365 (as part of the online Office365 application suite), Zoho Show, and Clearslide (formerly Sliderocket). The web-based PowerPoint alternatives usually have a feature/flexibility tradeoff. The upside of being web-based is that these applications can be accessed from any computer that is connected to the Internet. This might be a strong advantage if the presenter\u2019s goal is to give presentations from a wide range of computer platforms, post slides on the web, or give remote presentations.

Basic edits are possible with the online systems, but advanced features are usually lacking. For a comprehensive review of online presentation applications, please see Croxton\u2019s (2017) round-up of web-based alternatives to PowerPoint. A flexibility advantage of PowerPoint 365 and many of the online presentation application is the ability to collaborate online with multiple authors during the creation of a slide deck. The authors have the freedom to separately log into the system and make slides at different times and different locations. This feature can be valuable for student presentations that require group collaboration. The ability to collaboratively author slide decks online may not be necessary for most teachers, but it could be a strong advantage for educators who assign presentation projects to their students. Some online PowerPoint alternatives explicitly aim to break with potentially problematic PowerPoint conventions such as bullet point lists and linear slide decks. Of these, Prezi (prezi. com) has received the greatest degree of attention. Prezi is a free online presentation application that is somewhat like conventional PowerPoint yet has an innovative twist. The Prezi presentation begins with a large master slide\u2014the infinite canvas\u2014that works like a cognitive map of the overall presentation. The speaker can zoom into this canvas to reveal more details about a specific subtopic. The speaker can move through these subtopics in any desired order, which makes the flow of the presentation less confined than the typical linear order imposed by a conventional PowerPoint presentation. An unusual downside of Prezi is that the",

    "text": "zooming effects can trigger nausea in some audience members: an effect that is called \u201cPrezi sickness.\u201d The general recommendation is to avoid going too quickly through the presentation. The Prezi web site even has a special Prezi presentation on this topic\u2014\u201cAvoiding Prezilepsy\u201d\u2014that gives tips about ways to avoid motion sickness. The educational view of Prezi is that this technology functions more like a graphical organizer or mind-map than the usual PowerPoint bullet list. A slide that starts with a map of Europe or an image of the brain is a good starting point to give the students a context. The instructor can then zoom into a particular region of Europe or the brain to reveal more details. This zooming feature might help students make connections between the whole (or context) and the parts of the topic. Student perceptions of Prezi presentations are generally positive (Brock and Brodahl, 2013; Conboy et al., 2012; Virtanen et al., 2013). Some instructors feel that Prezi may hold audience attention better than the PowerPoint presentations. However, direct comparisons of Prezi to PowerPoint have  not found that Prezi produces superior learning performance (Castelyn and Mottart, 2012; Castelyn et al., 2013; Chou et al., 2015). Prezi has also been successfully used for student presentation projects, although some students report that Prezi is more difficult and time consuming to use than PowerPoint (Brock and Brodahl, 2013; Conboy et al., 2012).

Each slide format also has limits, such as a five bullet point maximum, to help prevent clutter and information overload. Problematic features, like flying bullet point animations, are not available. The constraints force users to create a highly focused message, somewhat like Twitter (Coget, 2015) or possibly pecha kucha (see Chapter 12). The simplicity of this platform might also facilitate the creation of presentations on portable computing devices such as smart phones and tablets. The Haiku Deck system also has a classroom environment feature that enables students to easily create and share slide decks during class. Teachers can use the Haiku Deck system to quickly make basic presentations, which could help to increase teacher productivity. In regard to cost, Haiku Deck has a limited free trial offering of three presentations. A monthly or annual subscription fee is needed to access the full capabilities of this platform.

In PowerPoint, voice-over narrations can be created through the \u201cSlide Show\u201d tab, then \u201cRecord Slide Show\u201d button. The resulting dialog box that pops up has checked radio buttons for \u201cSlide and animation timings\u201d (for recording the slide transitions) and \u201cNarrations, ink, and laser pointer\u201d (for recording voice and other features). The \u201cStart recording\u201d button begins a normal slide presentation while recording the speaker\u2019s voice from a microphone and the slide transitions with either mouse buttons or keyboard inputs. After finishing, the resulting presentation with the voice-over narration can be saved as a PowerPoint file or it can be saved as a video file format, such as mpeg-4 (file extension .mp4) or Windows media video (.wmv). The video formats are the best choice for online courses. These video files display the slides and play the audio recording for each slide as the slide deck advances, giving the presentation a stand-alone quality that eliminates the physical presence of the teacher. Narrated PowerPoint files can also be used for whiteboard- like functions. These might be particularly useful for doing basic math or similar kinds of demonstrations. For this feature, begin by inserting a blank slide at the point in the presentation that requires the whiteboard. The \u201cRecord Slide Show\u201d option for record \u201cNarration, ink, and laser pointer\u201d must be checked. During the recording, the keyboard command of control-p (for pen drawings) can be used to draw on the blank slide, just like a whiteboard. The control-l (for laser pointer) key combination can also be used for pointing out key areas of interest on the slide.",

For further technical information, please search for instructional videos on Youtube.com with the terms \u201cpowerpoint record voice narration.\u201d Some educators opt for more powerful video creation and editing software. Camtasia is a popular video creation application that can combine voice narration, screen captures, media files like PowerPoint, and more to create a unified video product that can be shared with students through online learning management systems. Camtasia and similar products can combine media sources in a much richer manner than PowerPoint, such as including videos of the instructor obtained via a web cam as part of the powerpoint presentation. Narrated PowerPoint presentation videos can be used in a variety of ways. Some instructors upload these files to online courses. The students in these online courses watch the powerpoint presentations in a manner that is similar to an in- class presentation. A well-known example of instructional lecture videos is the video offerings available at Khan Academy (see khanacademy.org).  Salman Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, had the insightful idea that video lectures would be a powerful tool for students, who would be empowered to use lecture material in a manner that was based upon their instructional needs. For example, students who miss a particular idea during the video presentation could replay the key part of the video to watch it a second time. The Khan Academy web site hosts a multitude of short educational presentations that cover a wide range of topics. Another possibility for recorded presentations that is gaining in popularity is the \u201cflipped\u201d classroom model. This teaching",

    "text": "strategy aims to reverse the traditional roles of the classroom and homework by moving the lecture parts of a class to an online environment. The cycle of flipped instruction begins by assigning short video lectures online before class to prepare for the classroom experience. Other educational content and activities, such as participation in discussion boards, may also be assigned as part of the classroom preparation. In the classroom, the emphasis is on hands-on learning activities, like working math problems, or interactions with other people, such as discussion activities. The teacher\u2019s role during the class meeting is to provide feedback and assistance to students rather than delivering educational content like traditional lectures. In brief, the general flipped teaching strategy is to move course content, which might possibly include recorded powerpoint presentations, to an online environment and use face-to-face classroom time for engaging learning activities rather than information delivery. There is currently considerable enthusiasm among educators for the flipped classroom approach. However, the overall effectiveness and best methods for flipped classroom teaching have not been clearly established yet (Abeysekera and Dawson, 2015; O\u2019Flaherty and Phillips, 2015). Some distance educators use special applications to give live powerpoint presentations online in real time, just like a face-to- face presentation. These applications are similar to popular video conferencing applications like Skype, Google Hangouts, or Apple Facetime, but they have additional features that support teaching activities. Many of these applications can share Microsoft Office files, including PowerPoint, and interactive white board spaces with the audience. Some of these software products are aimed at the",

An advantage of having a simultaneous meeting time is that the students and instructor can freely interact in a quick fashion, such as the instructor answering student questions as part of the presentation. A drawback is that some students may not be able to meet at a particular time. Online students, in particular, may feel that the requirement for a synchronized meeting time defeats the scheduling flexibility that is a highly desired component of online courses.",

The main feature of these technologies\u2014combining a speaker\u2019s voice with slide-based information\u2014is the shared multimedia presentation strategy across all of these technologies. The Microsoft PowerPoint alternatives described above do not substantially break the multimedia instructional standard of supplementing the spoken word with text and graphical images. It\u2019s true that some of these newer technologies have innovative features, such as Prezi- style zooming transitions and nonlinear slide order, but these innovations do not render multimedia learning approaches obsolete. The powerpoint presentation style is more of a social standard for modern presentations rather than being a specific technology produced by a single company (Knoblauch, 2012). There seems to be no emerging new technology that will trigger a radical break or paradigm shift away from the cultural standard for multimedia presentations. The wide-ranging technology possibilities combined with the rapid rate of change in the technology world can feel overwhelming at times. It can be difficult to keep up with the fast pace of change. Educators who feel this way can take heart by maintaining a focus upon human beings and the learning process rather than technology. The highly visual modern style of presentation capitalizes on the information processing strengths of human vision and the cognitive advantages of combining words and images in synergistic manner. These human strengths are timeless when compared to the ever-changing trends in technology.",

The font characteristics are a good starting point. The general recommendation is to use fonts from a sans serif font family, such as Calibri, Arial, or Helvetica. The sans serif fonts are distinguished by the lack of small curly endings or strokes at the ends of the letters (Figure 15.1), rendering them \u201cvisually simple\u201d (Kosslyn, 2007, p. 68). Sans serif fonts are generally preferred for computer screen monitors and similar situations because they are more easily read than other font families. Sans serif fonts are also higher-rated in regards to having a professional appearance (Mackiewicz, 2007a). The default PowerPoint fonts are usually for sans serif fonts like Calibri, so staying with a default font is usually a good choice.",

    "text": "An important general principle is that fonts must be a fairly large size in order to be visible to the audience. The sizes recommended commonly range from 22- to 44-points, depending on parameters such as classroom size and student distance from the screen. Michael Alley recommends the following settings for assertion-evidence formatted slides: left justification, bold weight, and 28-point. It is also noteworthy that Microsoft\u2019s PowerPoint 2016 has a default 28-point size for bullet point text items. Keep in mind that the largest fonts, like 44-points for titles, will force the presenter to use short phrases that can be vague or ambiguous. The degree of contrast between background and text is also important. Dave Paradi\u2019s web site thinkoutsidetheslide.com has a tool for evaluating color and contrast (see \u201cFree Resources\u201d). The user enters the background and text colors as RGB values, which is similar to the color values used for the design of web pages. The calculator simulates the colors in a sample slide and makes a recommendation about whether or not there is a sufficient degree of contrast. Some of these issues were already covered in Chapter 7, but the information in that chapter does not eliminate the need for real-world testing of color schemes. Most teachers and other presenters simply pick a pretty slide format from the gallery of possibilities that the software maker provides. Using built-in templates is convenient, but it may not be the optimal approach for teaching because these templates often contain undesirable colors, graphics, and layouts. It would be more effective for teachers to take the time and effort to create their own slide styles and layouts, especially if they intend to use the assertion-evidence formatted slide. Fortunately, there is a way to make slides without having to obsess about all these formatting",

    "text": "Television and computer monitors had the same shape for several decades. They were slightly rectangular, being a little bit longer in the horizontal plane. In 2003, the conventional shape of these displays started changing to a more overtly rectangular shape with a noticeably longer horizontal dimension. Most displays are now based upon this newer standard. Many people have noticed this difference on newer high-definition, widescreen televisions. Current television shows will fill the entire screen. In contrast, older television shows fit into the center of the display while leaving blank spaces on the left and right sides of the screen. The technical term for the shape of television screens and computer monitors is called the \u201caspect ratio.\u201d This is a ratio of the width to the height of the display area. A display that is four units wide and three units tall (or multiples of these) would have an aspect ratio of 4 units to 3 units, or 4:3. The two most common aspect ratios are the older, nearly square shape of 4:3 and the newer, more rectangular shape of 16:9 (Figure 15.2). On televisions, these aspect ratios are called \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cwidescreen,\u201d respectively,",

    "text": "Many textbook publishers for college-level courses offer teachers prepared powerpoint presentations as an ancillary resource. The advantage of these prepared slide decks is convenience. The downside is that prepared slide decks tend to be text-heavy repeats of material from the textbook. It\u2019s also possible that these resources may have been prepared by someone with little expertise in the subject matter, meaning that important concepts are not effectively identified or displayed. Prefabricated slides also encourage teachers to not prepare for their lectures, which ultimately leads to presentations that stumble through an unfamiliar slide deck. This possibility has led to the criticism that prefabricated slides are contributing to a \u201cde-skilling\u201d of faculty, who are reduced to a commentators role on someone else\u2019s slides (Gabriel and Griffiths, 2005, p. 372). Given these problems, it would seem to be best to avoid using powerpoint presentations from textbook publishers. Prepared slide decks may still be a valuable resource in spite of these problems. The images in these files can be easily copied into instructors\u2019 own powerpoint presentations, saving the instructors valuable time that would otherwise be spent hunting down images online or scanning textbook images into the computer. Discussing textbook images in class can also be appropriate for situations with textbook errors or confusing information. Doing so can offer the opportunity to walk the class through a difficult topic.",

The thoughts and organization can be composed on paper, then transferred to the software when the ideas are complete. This recommendation is similar to practices used in other disciplines. For example, the traditional approach for developing a film is to use story boards that show the composition of scenes and their overall order. A similar idea for powerpoint is to use post-it notes, with one post-it representing each slide (Duarte, 2008, pp. 28\u2013 29). The post-it notes can be physically edited and rearranged into a desirable order before the slides are created. PowerPoint also has features to help presenters perceive the overall feel and order of the slide deck. The \u201cslide sorter\u201d feature shows a comprehensive overview of the presentation, with each slide represented by a small thumbnail view. This view allows the presenter to examine the overall impression of the slide presentation and make any necessary changes in slide order, appearance, or content. Using this feature can be helpful for identifying global organization problems prior to the presentation delivery, although testing the presentation in the actual setting is the only way to ensure effectiveness.",

    "text": "Educators have an obligation to educate everyone in their classroom, including students with sensory disabilities. Powerpoint is primarily a visual medium, so the main accessibility concern is making the slide information available for students who may have vision deficits. As mentioned in Chapter 7, a minor yet common visual disability is insensitivity to the colors red and green. A good design principle for addressing this problem is to avoid or minimize the use of critical slide elements that are either red or green. For example, red arrows might seem like a good choice for highlighting important aspects of a diagram, but perceiving the color red may be problematic for some people. Blue, green, or yellow would be better color choices for highlighting purposes. If presenters have concerns about color visibility, the web site Vischeck.com has a tool for testing how color insensitive people experience images. The web site allows users to upload images and view them without certain colors in a manner that simulates color blindness. Teachers can use this feedback to determine whether or not critical information might be unavailable to color insensitive students. Students with severe visual disabilities may need assistive technologies that convert powerpoint deck text into speech, thereby enabling the student to listen to the slide deck. An important part of this technology is that the slide deck must be properly designed to make the text-to-speech conversion process work well. Images and hypertext links should include \u201calt\u201d tags (short for \u201calternative\u201d) that contain brief explanations that document the purpose or key idea. The assistive technologies use",

    "text": "system or distribute these files to their students via email. A problem with sharing the PowerPoint files is that students may not have the correct software to open the file, which can be an expensive problem to solve. Another problem is that PowerPoint files are formatted in a manner that makes them poor candidates for printing hard copies. A 44-point title font on a full-page slide, for example, is enormous on a printed page. Students may waste paper if they simply print the file without reformatting it. Teachers can improve on the common practice of simply sending out the powerpoint files without much additional effort. Nathans-Kelly and Nicometo recommend that the archival format for powerpoint presentations should be an Adobe Acrobat document (sometimes called \u201cpdf\u201d for \u201cportable document format\u201d) rather than the original PowerPoint format (Nathans- Kelly and Nicometo, 2014). These pdf documents are less software- bound because pdf software is available for free from Adobe. Most modern web browsers, such as Google\u2019s Chrome, can open pdf files without needing any additional software. This makes it nearly effortless for students to open these files from a web-based learning management system. Another pdf file advantage is their smaller size, which makes the files easier to post on a web site or send as an email attachment. In general, the pdf document file format is better suited than PowerPoint for the creation of paper-based documents that might be used for note-taking or studying efforts. There are three possible methods to create a pdf document from a PowerPoint presentation. If the Adobe Acrobat software is installed on your PC, an Adobe pdf file can be created by going to the \u201cfile\u201d tab and selecting \u201cprint\u201d (or simply select control+P on the keyboard). To make a pdf file, the \u201cprinter\u201d setting must be set",

It is well worth the small amount of extra effort to prepare these nicely formatted pdf files for students. Another useful tip for archiving PowerPoint files is to put documentation that might be too detailed for the presentation into the \u201cnotes\u201d part of the slide deck (Nathans-Kelly and Nicometo, 2014). During the slide deck creation, the teacher might enter important information, such as context or references, in the notes part of the slide where it cannot be seen by students during the presentation. Other possibilities for the notes area include direct quotes or brief explanations about the purpose of the slide. This practice prevents the presentation slides from being cluttered by details during the presentation but still preserves these important details for an information-rich handout. To view these notes, the students would need to receive a paper handout or a pdf file that has been formatted to include the notes along with the slide thumbnails. This approach is a clever way to strike a balance between the need to keep a visually simple presentation appearance, yet still give the students an information-rich take- home document with more details.",

    "text": "Having the right hardware setup enables a special presentation mode that gives the audience and the presenter different views of the slide presentation (Figure 15.3). The PowerPoint \u201cpresenter view\u201d gives the audience the full screen slide display. The presenter, in contrast, sees a smaller version of the slides along with more information and additional options, such as notes, navigation buttons, and a timer. The essential requirement for using the presenter view is that the projection setup must have two separate monitors, one for the presenter and a projector for the audience, that have two separate connections to the computer. The advantage of using the presenter view is that the presenter has a rich feature set of navigation tools and other tools available on their display screen. Seeing the next slide in the queue can help smooth the transitions between slides. Presenters will be less likely to forget the content of the next slide or skip a few slides ahead. The availability of the notes view can be valuable to remind the speaker of important points or information that needs to be shared with the students yet would be too excessive to put on to the projected screen.",

    "text": "The presenter view is very useful, but it can be tricky to use at times. Care must be taken to not rely on the presenter view feature too much. Overreliance can bind the presenter to the monitor and take the presenter\u2019s focus away from the audience (Kosslyn, 2007). Another potential problem is that the links or buttons shown in the presenter view are just images, rather than real links. This can be confusing and lead to errors during the presentation. An expert-level tip for using the presenter view mode is to think of the presentation as having two screens that are positioned side-by-side. The presenter\u2019s view is on the left and the audience view is on the right. These screens, however, are linked and continuous with each other. The mouse is not restricted to one screen and can be moved to the other by going either left or right. For example, activating a button on the PowerPoint presentation might require the presenter to move their mouse from the left to the right, off the presenter\u2019s screen and on to audience screen, in order to make it extend over into the view that the audience sees. Once in the audience, view the mouse cursor can click on buttons to activate them. A similar process can be used to display information in another window. For example, a Youtube.com video that is open in a web browser window may need to be shown to the audience. This window can be selected and then dragged from the left presenter screen rightward to the projected screen for the audience. When done, the browser window will need to be selected on the right in the audience\u2019s view and dragged from right to left to move it back to the presenter\u2019s view. This process of moving from one screen to the other by moving left-right can be somewhat tricky, but with practice, these kinds of transitions can be mastered.",

    "text": "At times, teaching feels like a constant battle to stay just one step ahead of where the students are in the course. This is especially true for new teachers who often struggle to develop content materials for their courses. Therefore, teachers need a long-term strategy in order to overcome the urgency of developing materials at the last minute. Teaching the same courses repeatedly year after year offers faculty members a chance to continuously improve their course presentations and see these presentations gradually evolve over several semesters. Sometimes, a teacher might randomly find a good example or activity to use for a future class. Powerpoint can function like a filing cabinet for saving these new materials and ideas. It can store all of the interesting ideas or information in the relevant slide deck until the next time the presentation is needed. The text on the slides and the images are obvious ways to organize the pertinent information. Multimedia resources can also be collected as links, such as links to Youtube-based video clips. Comments can be inserted like post-it notes to document future changes that might be worthwhile. Another possibility is to save information in the \u201cnotes\u201d option for each slide.

The information, ideas, and intentions are important starting points, but they ultimately count for nothing if the final product cannot be delivered in front of an audience. Teachers must be able to effectively implement the technology in the classroom in order to succeed. The numerous ideas outlined here may seem somewhat overwhelming at first. However, instructors need not implement all of these ideas in order to achieve better presentations. They can pick and choose the strategies and technical elements that seem to be the most important. Also worthwhile is thinking of powerpoint- use as a technical skill that can be developed slowly over time. Consistently following this approach over a few years will lead to a dramatic improvement in presentations, one that may result in recognition on campus for being a masterful speaker.",

A second goal of the opening is provide students with an overview of the topic. This preview may have cognitive benefits by preparing the students for the direction that the class will take. Let\u2019s begin with a brief summary of the guiding principles that went into the general design of this presentation. For high- contrast visibility, the slides have black text on a white background (Figure 16.1). I used the assertion-evidence layout for most of the slides in order to provide complete ideas to the students rather than fragmented phrases. The main message of each slide is positioned at the top of the screen to maximize the visibility in a classroom setting. The font formatting of the slide titles follows the recommendations for evidence-assertion layouts: Calibri font (from the sans-serif font family), 28-point size, and bold weight (Alley, 2013). Formatting the shape of the slide for a widescreen aspect ratio (16:9) takes advantage of all of the space on the classroom screen. The opening slide is a \u201ctwo content\u201d type layout in PowerPoint terminology (Figure 16.1). On the left, the slide contains the title of the topic, plus an overview of what students can expect. On the right, an image of students from my university appears.

    "text": "the topic. This is an effortless way powerpoint can help draw the audience into the presentation topic (Kosslyn, 2007). The opening slide is important for sparking some interest in the topic, but it is rarely sufficient by itself to really set the stage for learning. We need to go a little bit deeper to lay a foundation with the students about why this topic is interesting and important. For the topic of variability, I ask the students to do a simple thought experiment: What would the world be like if everyone was exactly the same, down to the smallest detail? This second slide (Figure 16.2) illustrates the question\u2019s concept by showing an image of identical gingerbread man cookies. The idea is to ask students to think about the opposite of variability, a world in which everyone is identical, just like cookies stamped out by a cookie cutter. The typical student reactions to this thought experiment is that a world with identical people would be quite boring. Human variability is special and valued. This slide has an assertion-evidence structure with the important idea stated at the top. The evidence part of this slide is an image of gingerbread men that are identical, which provides the visual means to reinforce the verbal message. This image helps the students grasp the concept of my thought experiment. It also helps to make an emotional point about the thought experiment, which might help to make it more memorable. Almost everyone likes cookies. Maybe some of these positive associations transfer to the topic of statistics by showing a slide that pairs them together.",

The assertion part of the next slide (Figure 16.3) provides the key term \u201cvariability\u201d and a definition of the key term (individual differences between people). The evidence part of the slide is a large family from South Africa that has a wide range of skin tones. It\u2019s quite a contrast from the preceding slide with the identical gingerbread man cookies. I chose this image because this simple physical evidence can quickly and easily make an important point about human variability. This image can also serve as a jumping off point for class discussions. An instructor could ask the class for other examples of human variability that are occurr in this image. They could also discuss how we can only see physical differences in this image. The social or psychological differences between these family members must be equally large.",

It sends the clear signal that the introduction is over and the body of the presentation is about to start. The segmentation principle from multimedia learning suggests that it is beneficial to break down educational content into groups or chunks (Mayer, 2009). Doing so will help to prevent the possibility of overloading the audience with too much information. The audience will also appreciate knowing the transition points in a presentation (Duarte, 2010). Another transition possibility is to show the outline from the opening slide again and cue the new subtopic to show students the overall progress through the topic.",

I drew the basic graph design with a Sharpie pen on regular printer paper, scanned the drawing into the computer with an inexpensive scanner, and then inserted it into the powerpoint file. The black/white scanned image blends seamlessly into the black/ white theme of the slide. I added the terms like \u201cfrequency,\u201d \u201ccentral tendency,\u201d and \u201cscores\u201d to the scanned image in powerpoint. Because it\u2019s the key concept for this slide, I placed the term \u201ccentral tendency\u201d at the top of Figure 16.5. I colored the arrows blue to help draw student attention to key features of the graph. The color blue minimizes potential problems for people with red-green color insensitivity might experience. Creating this image might seem like a lot of extra work, but it involves little more work than drawing a diagram on a chalkboard. The benefit of putting this diagram in powerpoint is the availability for future classes. Critics might fault images like the ones in Figures 16.5 and 16.6 for looking amateurish or homemade. They might also look down on using images from web sites like Wikipedia that have open licenses for sharing. These are valid opinions. It is undeniable that hand-drawn images lack the professional quality of images made by expert artists and graphic designers. My opinion, however, is that teacher-made resources like these are certainly acceptable for classroom use. Moreover, I feel that such do-it-yourself graphics are commendable for expressing teacher creativity and special efforts to promote learning. Most educators simply do not have enough time to make highly polished artwork on the computer. They may lack the specialized hardware, software, and training that might be required to make publication-quality graphics. Therefore, the guiding spirit for classroom content should be a",

It is sufficient to scan a drawn diagram or take a picture and highlight key areas, if these materials are successful in promoting student understanding. It is unrealistic to expect that every instructional aid will have the professional polish of textbook graphics. The students, who are the real audience, will appreciate these homemade creations even if they look less than perfect. They understand that their mission is to learn rather than being art or design critics. My overall suggestion is to not worry about graphic perfection in classroom materials unless you are creating materials for publication. Teachers should design powerpoint presentations as an individual expression of teaching creativity without worries about having the appearance look like textbook-quality images. The examples in this chapter follow this creative spirit to show teacher creativity in action.",

Doing so sped up the development time a bit, although the downside is that the images are more crude. The students don\u2019t seem to mind that these were drawn by hand.

The term platykurtosis refers to flat frequency distributions. This term is unusual and rarely used, so students might have difficulty remembering it. The joke in the next slide (Figure 16.10) is that a platykurtic distribution is shaped like a platypus. This joke usually gets some eye rolling and a few groans, but the students seem to appreciate the attempt to introduce humor to the topic. Although this joke may seem like pointless fun, it has a serious reason behind it. The combination of emotion with the information, as well as the association with a familiar and distinctive animal, should strengthen student memory for an obscure technical term.

    "text": "The graphics in Figures 16.11 and 16.12 were created for this presentation, with the graphic in Figure 16.11 being inspired by a textbook illustration that was useful but somewhat ambiguous. I made the graphics in Figure 16.12 with PowerPoint\u2019s formula and table tools. The deviation score part of the table in Figure 16.12 uses color (yellow) to direct attention to the most important part. Because it is the only color shown on the slide, the highlighting effectively draws attention. Using black and white for the basic formatting allows any color to stand out to the viewers, so applying color intentionally can highlight key features of the graphic. The body of the presentation finishes with an example that involves calculations. This example takes the information that was presented and illustrates how it should be worked. This part of the class involves modeling the behavior that students will need to do on the exams. It also provides a practical application of the concept covered during the body of the lecture.",

    "text": "The body of the presentation is a lecture that walks the students through the basic concepts and finishes with an example of calculating standard deviation. This part of class takes about forty minutes, which is all the statistics lecturing that most students can handle. During this part, the students have been taking notes and occasionally participating by asking questions. They have seen an example of the calculations. Most of the students have been nodding their heads up and down throughout the lecture, suggesting that they understand the class content (although experienced teachers know that this nodding can be deceiving). They have not, however, been challenged very much. This is a good time to shift the pedagogy strategy away from lecturing and towards active learning. The general strategy for my statistics course is to begin by lecturing and then follow-up with active learning exercises when student attention is nearly exhausted. After the lecture part, the students must do the same calculations by themselves to see if they can master the topic. This is the student- centered, active learning part of the class. This general approach of mixing lecturing with other kinds of active learning exercises is well supported by research studies (Bligh, 2000). This active learning part of the class provides important feedback to the students about their understanding of the topic. Students who are struggling can get assistance from their colleagues or the instructor. At this point, I distribute a handout that contains short exercises similar to the example covered in the lecture. These exercises also correspond with computational questions students will find on future examinations, so it is important for them to be",

The hope is that this slide can establish the usefulness of what we have accomplished in class. Figure 16.16 shows that standard deviation can also be used as a form of measurement. This slide uses Shaquille O\u2019Neal as an example of someone who is extremely tall and thus reinforces the concept of his being an outlier, which is a concept that was introduced in the previous class period. The new wrinkle at the end of this lecture is that his height could be expressed with standard deviation as a form of measurement.

To give the students access, I uploaded the subsequent pdf file to the course management system. This upload comprises the second life of the powerpoint presentation as a document. An example of a handout for the current presentation appears in Figure 16.17 for the slide that defines variability. This particular handout was printed with the \u201cnotes page\u201d option to put the presenter\u2019s notes on the handout. Providing this additional information gave the slides a context that would help students understand the key point of the slide after the presentation. Another useful function of the slide notes is, again, to provide documentation for the images or other information. The documentation for this image was not shown to the students on the projection screen, though it is available in the handout. A possible indirect benefit of including the documentation for the image is that it sets a good example to students about the importance of documenting the information sources, and thereby helps to communicate expectations for academic writing. The notes feature might also be useful for other kinds of documentation, like technical details or citing page numbers from the textbook. Plenty of space is available at the bottom of the page for students to add their own notes.",

The first goal of high visibility was achieved through a black/white color combination, large sans-serif font, and positioning the most important text high on the slide. A second goal was to direct student attention to areas of the slide that were particularly important. It was achieved by using arrows, colors, and highlighting. A third goal was to maintain emotional engagement throughout class. Using images that were visually interesting yet relevant and informative were achieved this goal. Humor, sparingly used during the lecture, alleviated the tedium of a strictly-lecture approach. Switching from lecturing to an active learning exercise was used to increase student engagement at a time when the students\u2019 ability to maintain attention on the lecture reached a low point. In regard to behavioral goals, the slides were made available as an Adobe pdf file before class for students to use as a note-taking resource. Using the \u201cnotes\u201d feature of powerpoint provided context for the slide and documented the sources of the images.",

The class ending emphasized important take-home ideas, including some ideas that students will encounter again in future classes. Altogether, a presentation like this has a coherent, logical story line. It gently leads the students through a topic that most people find to be difficult and uninteresting. The most important goal of any class is to improve student cognition. In this example, powerpoint features used in strategic ways effectively helped promote understanding of content that students often struggle with. The assertion-evidence slide layout in most of the slides provided text complemented by relevant instructional graphics. In this example, a mathematical concept (variability) was often illustrated with graphs exemplifying this concept. Some of the graphics appeared side by side so as to facil- itate comparisons. Complex topics, like calculating variance and standard deviation, were broken down into smaller parts that were gradually introduced to students over a sequence of several slides. Using this gradual build approach prevented cognitive overload. Powerpoint also supported an active learning exercise by commu- nicating instructions and providing feedback on student answers. The format and structure of this powerpoint example uses multimedia learning principles to help students make important connections. The assertion-evidence structure pairs statements with visual images, which is an example of multimedia learning (or dual coding). Some of these images were used to stimulate student interest, but most served to support and reinforce the concepts stated in the title of the slide. The signaling principle was used to point out features of interest with arrows or colored",

The information was carefully segmented by spreading the information over multiple slides. The use of transition slides also segmented the parts of the presentation into related groups. An effort was made to avoid using the slides as a teleprompter, which follows the redundancy principle. Finally, the slides in this example presentation have only the minimal features needed for education: text and instructional images. Leaving out unnecessary colors, decorations, animations, and transitions exemplifies the coherence principle. At this point, some readers may be having a negative reaction: This is the most boring slide deck ever! It had no colorful slide themes, no zooming bullet points, and no exploding slide transitions. For these concerns, consider the potential benefits of the Spartan slide deck. The absence of these commonly used and abused powerpoint features makes the critical information stand out on the slide, which focuses student attention. Every single feature on the slide is prominent because it has no extraneous information to compete with. All of the slide elements are carefully and intentionally planned in order to contribute in some meaningful way to student learning. The positive result is that the slide deck has an effortless and transparent quality which focuses on learning rather than on superficial presentation gimmicks. Powerpoint technology only needs to support the goals of teaching. Anything else is superfluous and detracts from the educational value of the presentation. The example in this chapter shows how much more can be done with powerpoint than simply listing information. The",

The design recommendations here should, hopefully, avoid the dreaded \u201cdeath by powerpoint\u201d experience in the classroom. Powerpoint presentations have some positive attributes, but the quality of the actual presentations often falls short of the potential that this medium has to offer. The challenge, then, is to harness these positive features and use them intentionally to support student learning. Altogether, it seems that the future of powerpoint in education is not as dark as some critics have suggested. Multimedia presenations have an amazing educational potential provided that we use it in a skillful way. The future of powerpoint and multimedia- based learning in education is really quite optimistic. In order to offer now some big-picture thoughts about powerpoint and the future of powerpoint in education, I will start with future directions for research, which is needed to better understand how powerpoint works in an educational setting. Next, I will consider the standards that surround powerpoint with the aim of going beyond the current standards, which are often weak presentation practices. I will close with thoughts about the relationship between powerpoint and pedagogy and the potential of powerpoint as a medium for creative teaching.",

    "text": "When powerpoint was introduced to the classroom, a wave of studies compared the new powerpoint technology to older classroom technology, typically blackboards and overhead projectors. These initial comparison studies produced a mixed bag of results, with most studies showing no measurable improvement (see Chapter 3 and Appendix A). It would be somewhat inaccurate to say that these studies demonstrated that powerpoint had failed in the classroom. Rather, these media studies were misguided by focusing too much on technology, rather than concentrating on the teaching methods that the technologies supported (R. E. Clark, 1983, 1991). A general fault of these studies is their tendency to say very little about the pedagogy, such as the details of how the instructors used powerpoint to teach students. Clearly, we need no further media comparison studies (see Appendix A) or surveys about students\u2019 general feelings towards powerpoint presentations (see Appendix B). When combined, at least 140 studies have been published on media effectiveness and/or student attitudes towards powerpoint. It seems unlikely that further studies of this nature will reveal anything useful. A powerpoint research area that needs more attention is the understanding of how different slide layouts might affect learning. Clearly, an endless stream of slides with numerous bullet point lists is very ineffective. In spite of this common knowledge, relatively little progress has been made towards making slides with better designs. Research on the assertion-evidence slide layout suggests it is more effective than the usual bullet point list, but more work needs to be done in this area. The use of instructional images in support of reading has been thoroughly examined by educational psychologists, but a corresponding",

    "text": "analysis of images in presentations seems lacking. We need a new generation of powerpoint studies that focuses specifically on the structure, layouts, and images used in powerpoint slides and how these might help or hinder learning. Diving into the details of slide formatting might seem rather dull and technical, but this area is the most likely source for the greatest possibility of future educational gains. A second area for future research concerns the research methodologies employed in the study of powerpoint. A desirable approach would be to use highly focused outcome measurements that are more sensitive than global assessments (e.g., quizzes or exam scores) to gain a higher degree of sensitivity. Research on effectiveness could achieve such higher sensitivity through fine- grained analyses of how educational slides directly impact specific questions on examinations. For example, a study by Diesel and colleagues used seventeen multiple-choice questions (that were individually analyzed in a comparison of standard slides) to slides with the assertion-evidence format (Diesel et al., 2006). This item-level analysis allowed the investigators to make specific conclusions about how a topic from a particular slide impacted the correct response rate on the quiz item related to that slide. This kind of highly focused link between specific slides and specific quiz questions might be much more sensitive\u2014and hopefully more illuminating\u2014than making global comparisons from overall quiz or exam scores. A third possible area for future research might lie in what the medical research community calls translational research.

A related possibility is that powerpoint might encourage an attitude that instructors must achieve maximum efficiency in every teaching moment (C. Adams, 2009), which could promote a fast pace and impatience with student questions. 4.\t Being too linear. Powerpoint imposes a rigid order on the presentation, which makes the presentation default to a linear progression through the slide deck. Instructors may need to break with the predetermined order to encourage nonlinear exploration of a topic, especially in regard to student questions. 5.\t Tired bullet point lists. The default powerpoint slide layout is a bullet point list. The problem, however, is that presenters often overuse bullet points or use them in an ineffective manner. Educators can benefit from replacing the overused bullet point lists with slides based upon the assertion-evidence format, which combines statements and informative graphics. Slides that focus on instructional images rather than text may also be an improvement. Bullet point list layouts can have a beneficial role, but presenters must be careful to avoid making every slide follow this structure. 6.\t Overreliance on lecturing. The default teaching mode of many college professors is the lecture method, and powerpoint-use may encourage this style of teaching. Overuse of lecturing leads to the problem of student inattention and passive learning. Accordingly, the successful powerpoint lecture",

As we saw with the 1960\u2019s, many educators thought television would revolutionize the field of education. More recently, the introduction of personal computers and the Internet have received much attention and enthusiasm from educators. Perhaps this viewpoint\u2014that technology will be an educational game-changer\u2014is itself a default cultural value in the field of education. We continuously search for the next silver bullet technology that will improve education. One thing that psychology research tells us, though, is that this search may be futile because certain human-based aspects of the educational context, such as visual perception and cognition, have remained constant despite these changes in technology. The use of powerpoint is certainly an example of the enthusiasm for technology in the field of education. However, even though powerpoint technology has advantages, it does not necessarily lead to better instruction. The potential for improved instruction is there, but it needs to match with the fairly constant human potential to learn. The cautious conclusion we must always keep in mind is that powerpoint and related technologies are simply tools. There is no teaching magic in the technology. Powerpoint is not a panacea for the various challenges teachers face in their classes. Powerpoint technology is simply an instrumental means for achieving particular educational goals.

    "text": "must always place their pedagogy and instructional methods first when it comes to intentional design approached for instructional use. The technology tools, in contrast, should be a secondary consideration. The ideal powerpoint presentation does some heavy lifting in regard to achieving instructional goals, yet its use should be intuitive, effortless, and almost invisible to the students. The powerpoint presentation can be a canvas for the expression of ideas. We should not, in contrast, notice the canvas itself. The overemphasis of technology solutions in education suggests a needed practical change in regard to how teachers work. Sitting down at the computer and typing out the powerpoint presentation may seem natural if our default way of thinking equates the technology as the center of instruction. It may be better to begin preparing for a class by thinking about the educational goals of the day, and how to best achieve those goals. Once instructors establish these goals and methods, then it might be worth considering how powerpoint would support the instruction. In other words, powerpoint slide development should be the third or maybe even the fourth step in preparing for a class. Making technology the star of the educational show creates a technological dependency, but little emphasis is often given to training the teachers who run the technology. University or school administrators often believe that purchasing technology completes the objective of integrating technology into the classroom. The teacher training is an afterthought that is typically given no time, attention, or funding. However, purchasing technology is only the start of the process.

Nevertheless, teacher training is relatively neglected. To improve the effectiveness of powerpoint presentations, we must begin to treate this situation in a different manner.

This situation can only be improved by emphasizing more training for educators, so they can use the software features to their fullest potential. In the future, training educators to make the most out of the existing technology may be the area in need of emphasis most.

As we have seen, powerpoint in education is sometimes criticized as being a teacher-centered technology that promotes mere information delivery and passive learning. This technology may diminish the instructional dialogue between teachers and students, so that students ultimately submitting to the authority of powerpoint, merely transcribe information from powerpoint slides. Teachers are left offering little more than a modern, boring, traditional lecture. These views of powerpoint presentations are rather dark. Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. First, it is important to acknowledge that computer technology has played a progressively increasing role in our society over the last several decades. We spend much of our contemporary life looking at computer screens in some form or another, such as televisions, tablets, smart phones, and computer displays. In this cultural context, we should expect that computer-based information displays will play an essential role in the classroom environment. Suggestions to eliminate powerpoint in order to get \u201cback to the basics\u201d seem woefully out-of-step with our computer- based society. Powerpoint presentations may have their faults, but there are more advantages than problems. Computer technology is simply not going to disappear from the classroom. The next step in this powerpoint revolution is to admit that we have been using powerpoint in all the wrong ways. Death by powerpoint occurrs because our cultural expectation for presentations have gradually changed. The previous standard for presentations was to use 3 x 5 inch notecards to provide memory",

    "text": "cues for the speaker. The audience did not see this information. These memory cues were restricted to the presenter. With powerpoint, the presenter\u2019s notes generally turned into bullet points for the audience to see. As we have seen, this new standard fails due to placing too much text on the projected slide, which leads to a cognitive overload. Reading from the slide also conflicts with the students\u2019 attempt to listen to their instructor\u2019s spoken words. And the presenter typically ends up facing the screen instead of the audience, another presentation failure. These changes in our cultural expectations for presentations have led to a decline in the overall quality of modern presentations. The path forward to better powerpoint presentations should now seem clear. Eliminating unnecessary slide features and decreasing the amount of text will be useful. For content, students will benefit from presentations that express entire thoughts as statements. These statements should be accompanied by supporting visual evidence. Instructional images may promote efficient processing of information and promote student interest more than text-based information. The effective learning environment will need to switch from pure information delivery to other methods that promote more active pedagogy. Incorporating question points and seeking student feedback (either by raised hands or by response systems) will promote better communication between the teacher and the students. Instructors can encourage better note-taking by sending students unambiguous indicators of the important material they need to learn. The annotation of slides from a handout may be helpful for the note-taking process. These are some of the many ways we can better use powerpoint in the classroom than our current standard.",
